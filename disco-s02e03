Yes.<br> Sarek informed me.<br>  People are anxious to know what they are.<br>  MAN [OVER P.<br>A.<br>.]<br>: Attention all cadets.<br>  Duty log has been updated  Spock's connected to them.<br>  - How? - He left a log claiming  that he saw them long before they appeared to the Federation.<br>  But until we can speak to him, we have no answers,  and I don't know what else to do.<br>  I have no new angles to investigate.<br>  Except the one I'm giving you.<br>  I just came from Starbase Five.<br>  I went to the psychiatric unit.<br>  They wouldn't tell me where he was.<br>  They wouldn't let me see him.<br>  They wouldn't say what was wrong with him.<br>  Thy wouldn't even give me his personal effects.<br>  You're his next of kin, and you're a diplomat's wife.<br>  So I did the only logical thing.<br>  I stole his medical file.<br>  It's encrypted.<br>  Can you please open it?  [SIGHS.]<br> Mother.<br>  Please.<br>  [GROWLING.]<br>    [SCOFFS.]<br>  How was your walk?  I have dedicated everything to your cause.<br>  The least your uncle could do is acknowledge me.<br>  He and the rest of House Mo'Kai believe in you.<br>  We have enemies enough.<br>  There is no need to dream up imaginary ones.<br>  Kol-Sha is telling council members  that you are advising me  to eliminate the great houses entirely.<br>  My uncle is disseminating the truth to counteract his lies.<br>  He looks at me and sees a human.<br> They all do.<br>  You should not care what anyone sees when they look at you.<br>  On that subject, only my opinion matters.<br>  Why do you insist on speaking English to me?  I'm not a human, L'Rell.<br>  I'm a Klingon whose body was changed to resemble one.<br>  If we expect others to acknowledge my Klingon side  accept me as the Torchbearer you must treat me like Voq.<br>  If you are Voq, then want me back.<br>  Want me.<br>  You touch me  and that intimacy,  to me, Tyler, feels like  violation.<br>  AMANDA: Spock speaks highly of you, Captain Pike.<br>  Now my daughter does, too,  so I know I've come to the right people.<br>  Well, ma'am, that makes it all the harder for me to tell you  I can't open this file.<br>  If I did, I'd be in violation of the rules,  and my mother wouldn't like that.<br>  There is precedent in Starfleet case law  for a captain to invoke  Was she this bossy as a kid?  On Vulcan, we call it "persistent.<br> " And yes, she was.<br>  She learned that from me.<br>  Hmm.<br>  Bryce, get me Captain Vela on Starbase Five.<br>  Tell him it's high priority.<br>  BRYCE: Yes, sir.<br>  Ah.<br> Chris.<br>  You and my Bisabuela Nena are the only two people  in this quadrant still communicating on screens.<br>  Well, your grandma sounds like a smart lady.<br>  You should introduce us.<br>  Sorry I haven't returned your call.<br>  "Calls," Diego.<br>  I've been waiting for an update on my officer, Spock.<br>  VELA: I'm sorry, I can't give you one.<br>  His case is classified.<br>  I'm well within my rights as his captain to get a prognosis.<br>  Even if that weren't the case, Spock has information  on the signals I was assigned to investigate.<br>  Starfleet declared my mission priority one.<br>  The signals have nothing to do with it, Chris.<br>  Your guy is wanted for murder.<br>  He killed three of his doctors, then fled the starbase.<br>  PIKE: Why isn't word out about his escape  so that every starship can be on the hunt?  VELA: Elements of the case just got complicated.<br>  Some of Spock's files are missing.<br>  We have no idea how.<br>  Rest assured they've got people on it.<br>  PIKE: Thanks, Vela.<br>  Pike out.<br>  It's not true.<br>  My son is gentle and kind;  he wouldn't do that.<br>  I agree, Captain.<br>  Well, that makes three of us.<br>  But I don't think the "people" handling his case would concur.<br>  Our boy's in trouble.<br>  Whatever happened, he needs a fair shake.<br>  We need to find him before they do.<br>  Burnham, break into Mr.<br> Spock's medical file.<br>  That's an order.<br>  Lieutenant Spock's intellectual abilities  and capacity for reason are intact.<br>  Instead, his dissociation appears acutely emotional.<br>  E.<br>Q.<br> tests and his current disaffected state  suggest extreme empathy deficits.<br>  I'll transfer the rest of the files, and then  we can decide the best place to start.<br>  Your wheels are already turning.<br>  Logic dictates a few theories:  Spock didn't do it and he's wrongfully accused;  or he did murder those doctors in a mentally compromised state,  or in what he thought was self-defense.<br>  Or He did it because he's emotionally compromised.<br>  "Extreme empathy deficit"  is code for psychopathy.<br>  I can't deny that possibility.<br>  He didn't have a normal childhood.<br>  Sarek wanted Spock raised in the Vulcan manner.<br>  And any display of emotion was strongly discouraged.<br>  And in order not to confuse my son,  I began to hide my own.<br>  I was not a real mother  I wasn't what he needed.<br>  You gave us love every second.<br>  It was different with you, Michael.<br>  I gave you all my joy  and my affection  that I was not permitted to give to him.<br>  But Spock is half human.<br>  If he had been permitted to embrace the feelings  that I know he has inside of him,  it would've saved him from all the trouble that he's in now.<br>  [EXHALES.]<br>  Stop.<br>  Stop.<br>  Those images.<br>  Spock drew them.<br>  I'm sure of it.<br>  He must've  done them when he was in treatment.<br>  I thought that he left it in the past.<br>  But it's back.<br>  What is it?  Your brother called it the Red Angel.<br>  He started seeing it when he was a little boy.<br>  It changed him.<br>  [COMPUTER CHIRPS.]<br>  I'm sorry.<br>  I have to answer this.<br>  Michael.<br>  Thanks for answering.<br>  Of course.<br>  Are you all right? Is L'Rell?  For now.<br> She's still in power  but her opponents continue to challenge and discredit her.<br>  - It's volatile.<br> - How can I help?  The Federation needs to be aware of the situation.<br>  If L'Rell falls, peace falls with her.<br>  I'll pass it up the chain of command immediately.<br>  Thanks.<br>  - I should go.<br> - Wait.<br>  What?  I  I don't know.<br>  I like the beard.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  I heard, postwar, the Klingons are growing their hair again.<br>  The rumors are true.<br>  How are you?  I've been dealing with some things  regarding my foster brother.<br>  I thought I hit a dead end  but Amanda came and got me back on track.<br>  Can you ship her over here when you're done with her?  I'm feeling a little stuck, myself.<br>  You've got me, right now.<br>  [SIGHS.]<br>  I understood my role here, to aid L'Rell.<br>  But I'm afraid I'm hurting her.<br>  I'm an easy target for the old guard.<br>  What does L'Rell think?  That their opposition is part of the fight,  and their ignorance will be their downfall.<br>  You admire her.<br>  I do.<br>  It sounds like she feels the same way about you,  and values having you there.<br>  Try to take her at her word.<br>  It's, uh, it's late here, so  Take care of yourself, Michael.<br>  You, too, Ash.<br>  Yeah.<br>  [EXHALES.]<br>  Greetings, everyone,  and welcome to Shadow Exercises.<br>  As Starfleet's future chiefs and captains,  this is your opportunity  to build rapport with a senior officer,  and see firsthand what their duties entail.<br>  So let us begin.<br>  PIKE: Look sharp, people.<br>  This is our future competition.<br>  Is that your captain?  Um, Ensign Sylvia Tilly, sir.<br>  Fully present and utterly focused  on this very important exercise  for which I am all ears, Captain.<br>  Your dedication is noted, Ensign.<br>  So, what should we do?  How 'bout we marry some folks,  even if they're not that into each other, hmm?  [LAUGHS.]<br>: Oh, very good, sir.<br>  Captain.<br> I need your authorization for this.<br>  I don't understand.<br> That was funny.<br>  The captain of this ship isn't funny, he's terrifying.<br>  You may be thinking of an old captain, Captain Lorca.<br>  Was he shorter? And blonder?  And much, much whiter? Because that's who I'm looking for.<br>  [DISTORTED.]<br>:- 'Cause that's who I'm looking for.<br> PIKE:- I'm ready if you are.<br>  He's not the man I need to talk to.<br>  PIKE:- Hop in the chair, Ensign.<br> - Yes, sir.<br>  Let's run a systems test.<br>  Where is the other captain?  Uh, a systems test.<br> Uh, where?  Where? In the chair.<br>  Oh.<br> S-Sorry.<br>  Run checklist protocol.<br>  Acknowledged.<br> Uh, step one.<br>  Tilly, this is not right.<br> My plan is falling apart.<br>  [QUIETLY.]<br>: Calm down.<br>  I'm hearing considerably fewer syllables  out of you than normal.<br>  I- I know the chair can be intimidating,  but are you okay?  No.<br> We are not okay.<br> I want the captain.<br>  - I want the captain.<br> - This is the captain.<br>  Ensign, what is going on?  Tilly, answer Captain Pike.<br>  Tilly No.<br>  I'm not listening to you anymore.<br>  You tricked me and you lied to me.<br>  I didn't lie.<br> He's lying.<br>  He's an imposter.<br>  Shut up!  Ensign Sylvia Tilly!  No.<br> I didn't.<br> I'm sor I w  She drove me to it.<br> I  That doesn't make any sense.<br> I'm s  I'm not  I'm not [SNORTS.]<br>  I'm not.<br>  I quit.<br>  [DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN.]<br>  [HANDS RUBBING TOGETHER.]<br>  [GRUNTS SOFTLY.]<br>    You were spying on me.<br>  Your mind plays tricks.<br>  What do you have against me?  Why do you stop speaking when I enter a room?  You'll speak now or I'll slit your throat.<br>  [GROWLS.]<br> If you feel aggrieved,  take it up with my niece.<br>  It is not House Mo'Kai that is keeping secrets from you.<br>  What secrets?  L'Rell will be angry  I broke her trust,  but I cannot keep this from you any longer.<br>    [BABY COOING.]<br>  UJILLI: Behold,  the son of L'Rell and Voq.<br>    I learned I was pregnant right as Voq  was being transformed into a human.<br>  I could not activate him on Discovery  while carrying a child.<br>  The gestation occurred ex-utero.<br>  That is why it is so small.<br>  "It"?  - Does he even have a name? - No.<br>  I have never met the child.<br>  The baby is a vulnerability.<br>  He's just a vulnerability to you?  All these secrets and lies  to protect a failed wartime mission.<br>  What did you gain, L'Rell?  You think your discovery, made moments ago,  is somehow greater  than the pain I have lived with all this time?  [PANTING.]<br>  Would you have ever told me?  I wanted you to be able to return  to a human life without obligation.<br>  You will not be here forever, Tyler.<br>  Why do say that? With such certainty,  like you know who I am better than I do?  I chose to be here.<br>  I'm committed to that decision.<br>  Why did you call Michael Burnham?  I trusted her to notify the Federation that an insurrection  of the High Council might be brewing.<br>  So she is the only one you trust.<br>  That is the only reason it was that  particular human woman?  Yes.<br>  That is the reason.<br>  [EXHALES.]<br>  On my way home, I looked into one of Voq's memories.<br>  You and he walked across the ancestral cliffs of the Mo'Kai.<br>  The sun set.<br>  The sky dripped amethysts.<br>  Our love was greater than that of Kahless and Lukara's.<br>  Voq thought so, too.<br>  When I stared down at that baby  his skin, the same as Voq's,  the distinction that made him feel like an outsider,  that made his life so hard,  I felt like I was looking at myself.<br>  For the first time, the two sides of me felt whole.<br>  I can't be Voq.<br>  I can't give you back those memories of long ago.<br>  But I can promise you a new love story.<br>  I am his father,  and I am devoted to you.<br>  Let's bring our son home.<br>  The rest will come.<br>  When did it first appear to him?  It appeared to Spock  the night you ran away from home.<br>  The Logic Extremists had bombed the Learning Center  and almost killed you.<br> I don't blame you  for wanting to escape from Vulcan to Earth.<br>  I didn't make it past the outskirts of ShiKahr.<br>  I still don't know how Sarek found me.<br>  He didn't.<br>  That was Spock.<br>  We were about to alert the High Command  to begin a search effort,  and Spock walked into the room.<br>  He was still in his pajamas.<br>  His eyes were wide, and he said  that the Red Angel had visited him  and told him where you were.<br>  That's where Sarek looked,  and there you were.<br>  Sarek and I always believed  that Spock used logic  to pinpoint your direction.<br>  He might have known what time you left,  how fast you were walking, what direction you were going in.<br>  And we just wrote the vision off as a figment of his imagination.<br>  But Spock never wavered.<br>  He said that the Red Angel was real.<br>  I've seen this angel, too.<br>  It appeared to me on our mission to the first signal.<br>  Were you the only one?  Yes.<br>  And I wrote it off as a trick of the mind.<br>  And I didn't get the sense that it was nefarious.<br>  [SCOFFS.]<br>  I cannot believe I'm talking like this.<br>  I'm not even sure it was real.<br>  It is.<br>  What saved you  hurt your brother.<br>  That vision changed him forever.<br>  I  I watched him withdraw.<br>  I saw him lose trust in other people.<br>  I watched his openness vanish.<br>  It wasn't because of a vision.<br>  It was because of me.<br>  My presence was a danger to the family.<br>  If the Logic Extremists couldn't get to me,  they would try to get to him.<br>  And he was my little shadow.<br>  So I had to wound him deep enough to keep him away from me.<br>  What did you do?  The fact that you're not saying anything means  that you must have hurt him irreparably.<br>  Which is why the four of us can never get together,  which is why you're always too busy to see each other.<br>  I'm sorry.<br>  I am sorry for what I did.<br>  What I thought I had to do.<br>  I've reached out  so many times  to make amends.<br>  He's not interested.<br>  But I won't give up on him.<br>  I will find him.<br>  No.<br>  I will.<br>  He will not know me.<br>  He didn't know me either.<br>  Uncle.<br>  No, no!  [GASPING.]<br>  I've been awaiting your arrival.<br>  Your son is handsome.<br>  But I thought he could use  a little color.<br>  I will hunt you down and rip out your entrails  - with my bare hands.<br> - Doubtful.<br>  The paint I begged you to wipe from my face  was swimming with sensor implants.<br>  They are a listening device.<br>  I was only hoping to eavesdrop on your political strategies.<br>  But I never imagined  I'd learn of this.<br>  The High Council will not tolerate  - this dishonor.<br> - Well, I think  they are more likely to condone kidnapping  than harboring a spy.<br>  Your pet betrayed the council to Commander Burnham.<br>  Did he not?  What do you want?  I'm willing to part with him and let you flee  in exchange for control of the empire.<br>  You will agree to my terms and meet me  at your residence.<br>  Saru called down looking for you.<br>  You all right?  What's wrong? Have you been crying?  I asked first.<br>  [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER P.<br>A.<br>.]<br>  Talk to me.<br>  I need a problem I can solve.<br>  More than you know.<br>  Talk to me.<br> Haven't I been punished enough?  What happened up there was upsetting to me.<br>  I panicked.<br>  Tilly?  Tilly.<br>  Don't ruin what we have.<br>  We're not defeated yet.<br>  We're not defeated yet.<br>  After the dark matter hit me,  I s  I started to see a  ghost.<br> [EXHALES.]<br>  She's a girl that I knew when I was a teenager.<br>  Her name was May.<br> But she's dead.<br>  And the May that I knew was really meek and, uh  kind of goofy when you got to know her.<br>  But this May is different.<br>  She's, um she's insistent.<br>  She's grooming me for something.<br>  For what?  She hasn't said.<br>  Because you're ignoring me.<br>  And I'm getting scared.<br>  And we need a new plan.<br>  [PANTING.]<br>  I am losing it, Michael.<br>  She's wearing me down.<br>  I've been avoiding sickbay.<br>  But, at this point, I don't know what to do.<br>  I'm desperate.<br>  And after today, I'm never gonna make captain.<br>  MAY: Your eyes are dripping.<br>  'Cause I'm crying.<br>  [SNIFFLES.]<br>  She doesn't know what crying is.<br>  I've got to think.<br>  I'll be back to talk some sense into you later.<br>  She left.<br>  How can she not know what tears are?  That's impossible.<br>  Show me a teenage girl who's never cried.<br>  You can't.<br>  I know.<br> I'm a xenoanthropologist.<br>  And if May were a hallucination pulled from your subconscious,  then she'd know that emotion, because you know that emotion.<br>  So May is something, Tilly.<br>  But I don't think she's a ghost.<br>  Or a delusion.<br>  You said she appeared to you after the asteroid shocked you.<br>  But why did it shock you?  I held a piece in my hand,  and I wasn't zapped.<br>  The dark matter component of the asteroid,  it reacts when it's in proximity to one thing.<br>  Spores.<br>  You don't need sickbay.<br>  You need Stamets.<br>  [THUNDER CRASHES.]<br>  [BABY WHIMPERS.]<br>  Sign.<br>  I am still your chancellor.<br>  You are the Federation's puppet.<br>  Why is she such a threat to you, Kol-Sha?  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  The female?  She's nothing but a  [SPEAKS KLINGON.]<br>  that lies with a human.<br>  If that is the gravest insult you can hurl,  you are even less than I imagined.<br>  [GROWLS.]<br>  [BABY CRYING.]<br>L'RELL: I know  I am nothing to you once I have signed,  so be sure to kill us both, Kol-Sha.<br>  The one left standing will be the one who returns for you.<br>  [THUNDER CRASHES.]<br>  [GUARDS SNARLING.]<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  [SNARLING.]<br>  [FIERCE YELLING.]<br>  [BLADES CLANGING.]<br>    [ROARS.]<br>[SCREECHES.]<br>  [GROWLING, GRUNTING.]<br>  [THUNDER RUMBLING.]<br>  [YELLS.]<br>  [GRUNTING CONTINUES.]<br>    [FIERCE YELLING.]<br>  [YELLS, GRUNTS.]<br>  [YELLING NEARBY.]<br>  [FIERCE YELLING.]<br>    [THUNDER RUMBLING.]<br>  Enough.<br>  [WEAPON SQUEALS.]<br>  [ZAPPING, GRUNTING.]<br>  [CRACKLING.]<br>  KOL-SHA: Yes.<br> Feel it.<br>  Paralysis  is spreading to your organs.<br>  But I will not let you suffocate  until you've signed.<br>  Thank you for my ink.<br>  Now pass me that  pretty little finger.<br>  [CRACKLING.]<br>[GRUNTING.]<br>  Now  for my first act as chancellor:  an execution.<br>  Now  you can watch  your Voq die  for good.<br>  [ECHOING BOOMS.]<br>  KOL-SHA: What is that?    [WEAPON SQUEALS.]<br>  [GRUNTS.]<br>  [BREATH SEETHING.]<br>  [THUNDER RUMBLING.]<br>  TYLER: Why have you been spying on me?  GEORGIOU: Don't be cranky about it.<br> We have to ensure  that she stays in the chancellor's seat.<br>  Who's "we"?  Emperor  [CHUCKLES.]<br>: You have me confused with someone else.<br>  I'm Philippa Georgiou,  retired captain of the U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Shenzhou,  now Starfleet security consultant.<br>  [BABY FUSSING.]<br>  [GROANS.]<br>: Oh, children are parasites.<br>  Ungrateful.<br> Inconvenient.<br>  I had to find someone else  to feed mine, or I would have gotten nothing done.<br>  I will consider that advice.<br>  Thank you for your help.<br>  Gratitude is premature,  as long as the disemboweled leader of House Kor  is splattered on your floor.<br>  TYLER: He took our child, tried to force her to abdicate.<br>  We were defending ourselves.<br>  Kol-Sha killed your uncle it's an eye for an eye.<br>  I need a word with the chancellor.<br>  [THUNDER CRASHES.]<br>  Every minute you remain here, your councilors must reorganize  their tiny male brains  to rationalize why it isn't them standing on the dais.<br>  They will assume that all your decisions are Tyler's.<br>  He is a liability.<br>  Can you kill him?  [BABY CRYING.]<br>I had to ask.<br>  He is a liability, too.<br>  You can't show weakness  when it comes to either one of them.<br>  I will not choose between the chancellorship  and my son and his father.<br>  I told you what I am here to protect.<br>  I am not giving you a choice.<br>    I'm sorry I didn't tell you.<br>  I am sorry, too.<br>  But thanks to Burnham's insights,  we are closer to finding a solution.<br>  And getting you back into the Command Training Program.<br>  What about Captain Pike?  I am not familiar enough with the captain to anticipate his reaction,  but I do know that he has  a sense of humor and that he is fond of you.<br>  STAMETS: We should have results  in one second.<br>  [WHOOSHES.]<br>MAY: I told you  he was shorter, blonder,  whiter There he is.<br>  - That's the captain.<br> - No, he's not.<br>  Yes, he is.<br> That's where he flies.<br>  - What's going on? - She's back and she's pissed.<br>  Maybe at you.<br>  - Please hurry.<br> - Stop talking  to him until I tell you what to say.<br>  STAMETS: Just as I suspected.<br>  You are hosting a eukaryotic organism.<br>  - A fungus? - Obviously  multicellular, since it has  - opinions.<br> - Fungus.<br>  Don't you dare diminish  don't you dare diminish me.<br>  SARU: Anyone who works around the spore drive  is inoculated how did she contract it?  It's possible that a spore evolved  a resistance, like bacteria.<br>  And don't you call me bacteria.<br>  Or it's a different spore altogether than the ones we harvest here.<br>  When Discovery escaped the Terran universe, their spores  rained down on Engineering.<br>  If one attached itself to you  Hey, May.<br>  Is that her?  He's the villain.<br> Don't let him poison you against me.<br>  STAMETS: There's our hitchhiker.<br>  A multidimensional, fungal parasite.<br>  Why does it appear to be someone I knew when I was a teenager?  Brain manipulation, perhaps?  These people are lying.<br>  I am not a manipulator.<br>  You're special, Tilly.<br> You're my only chance.<br>  I need you.<br>  How do we get rid of it?  We use the attraction between the fungal spores  and the dark matter asteroid to suck her out of you.<br>  This might hurt a bit.<br>  [GRUNTING.]<br>  If you think you can destroy me, Captain,  you're in for a fight!  [GRUNTS, SCREECHES.]<br>  [YELLING IN PAIN.]<br>  [YELLS.]<br>  [FRANTIC SQUEALING.]<br>  Security breach by unknown alien species in Engineering.<br>  Engage quarantine protocol Alpha-Omega.<br>  [SQUEALING.]<br>        Such was the dishonor he brought.<br>  Secretly, he communicated with the Federation.<br>  He told them we are disunited and therefore weak.<br>  He betrayed us.<br>  Lest anyone think my arrangement with the human  outweighs my loyalty to the empire,  think again.<br>  [OTHERS GROWLING.]<br>  The traitor slaughtered a Klingon infant.<br>  My son.<br>  [OTHERS SHOUTING.]<br>  L'RELL: He would have assassinated your chancellor  had Kol-Sha not intervened.<br>  The leader of House Kor gave his life to defend mine.<br>  One house defending another.<br>  His sacrifice is a lesson to us all.<br>  I, too, have sacrificed.<br>  I will bear a child but once.<br>  Now  you are my children,  as I raise this family to greatness!  Do not refer to me  as Chancellor,  for I deserve a fiercer title.<br>  From this point forth,  you may call me  Mother.<br>  [OTHERS SHOUTING.]<br>    [BABY FUSSING.]<br>  You synthesized our heads  down to their neural mapping and genetic codes.<br>  This isn't your everyday Federation espionage.<br>  What kind of organization could pull that off?  GEORGIOU: This kind.<br>  Section 31.<br>  I've heard of black badges; never seen one.<br>  We've settled into orbit around Boreth.<br>  Are you sure you want your boy to become a monk?  [SCOFFS SOFTLY.]<br> It's what L'Rell wants.<br>  And you?  To know where I belong, and to whom,  and who belongs to me.<br>  My son will be raised  by the most devout followers of Kahless.<br>  No one leaves the monastery,  and no one who doesn't belong ever gets in.<br>  Not even his parents?  He'll never know me.<br>  Never know L'Rell, either.<br>  But he'll be safe.<br>  [BABY CRYING.]<br>  GEORGIOU: You should consider staying around.<br>  Our command believes misfits have merit,  so we keep busy.<br>  I'm surprised you call yourself a misfit, Emperor.<br>  The freaks are more fun.<br>  LELAND: Take us to warp.<br>  Control values his skill set.<br>  We would like you to work on your recruitment speech.<br>  Don't give me notes.<br>  He's in.<br>  Something has us locked on a place.<br>  I can fly in a web.<br>  Get down!  My people have a condition.<br>  It's terminal.<br>  Death is inevitable.<br>  You're my family.<br>  After everything we have been through  We're not gonna let you die.<br>   Star Trek: Discovery SO2EO3- Point of Light     <br>
