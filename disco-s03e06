Sir.<br>  Discovery has an experimental advanced drive system  that enables us to respond instantaneously anywhere in the galaxy.<br>  Word of this critical asset will not leave this room until I say so.<br>  Now, Argeth is on yellow alert.<br>  Our intel says that the Emerald Chain  might be making another move in the next 12 hours.<br>  The Andorian-Orion syndicate?  [Vance.]<br> In this part of the quadrant, yes.<br>  Osyraa and the Chain have been pushing hard lately.<br>  I don't know what they're after on Argeth, but they're not gonna get it.<br>  If things heat up, I need you to jump.<br>  We will be ready, admiral.<br>  Dismissed.<br>  [beeping noises.]<br>  - Are we supposed to get new holo-PADDs? - You already have them.<br>  Cool.<br>  Okay.<br> This is my new favorite thing.<br>  Your new badges also function as tricorders  and communicators and personal transporters.<br>  We'll get to those later.<br>  There are also upgrades to your consoles.<br>  Check it out.<br>  Doesn't seem that different.<br>  [Willa.]<br> Our team kept the interface similar for ease of transition,  but once you engage  Whoa!  What just happened?  That's the retrofitted programmable matter.<br>  It reads your bio-signs.<br>  - Do we really need all of this? - Hell, yeah, we do.<br>  [Willa.]<br> It's adaptive, learns and adjusts to your reflexes  to create an interface style unique to you.<br>  Feels smooth.<br>  And cool.<br>  Like glass.<br>  Whoops.<br> Didn't expect to This isn't the mess hall.<br>  [clears throat.]<br> Bye.<br>  Apparently, he hasn't adapted yet.<br>  [console trills.]<br>  Lieutenant Nilsson, we are being hailed by a vessel outside  - of the Federation's distortion field.<br> - [Willa.]<br> No one gets here  - unless they know where they're going.<br> - On-screen.<br>  [suspenseful music playing.]<br>  [purring.]<br>  Grudge?  [Book over recording.]<br> Hey, Michael.<br>  I'm recording this message in case I can't tell you in person.<br>  I was on my way to the Bajoran exchange when this guy next to me  started talking about a black box,  and I think his black box is one of the ones you're looking for.<br>  It's on Hunhau, Emerald Chain territory.<br>  I'm gonna do some looking around.<br>  If things don't go well,  I'll set the ship to bring Grudge to you if I'm not back in 24 hours.<br>  Now, despite her glacial emotional process,  her initial reluctance towards you is melting away.<br>  I'll come find you two, okay? I won't be long.<br>  This was three weeks ago.<br>  What would the black box tell us about the Burn?  Since it has a record of a ship's last moments,  every vessel destroyed by the Burn  should have stopped recording at the same microsecond.<br>  But the two I found in my year here didn't.<br>  If Book found a third one and it shows the same variance,  that means the Burn didn't happen all at once.<br>  Suggesting what?  Suggesting the Burn had a point of origin.<br> We can triangulate the data to locate it.<br>  We have got to get to Hunhau.<br>  I'm so sorry, Michael, but at the moment, we cannot.<br>  - Why? - The admiral has ordered Discovery  to be ready to jump to Argeth within the next 12 hours.<br>  - Ah, it won't take me that long.<br> - Commander.<br>  To be clear, the situation there could heat up any time in the next 12 hours.<br>  Captain,  the Federation cannot stabilize  while the cause of the Burn remains a question.<br>  And there's a man's life at stake.<br>  There are many lives.<br>  Today, I saw how vulnerable the Federation has become.<br>  The admiral would not be convinced by a cat in a ship.<br>  I understand this will be difficult, but, please, resume your duties  and prepare the crew for a possible jump to Argeth.<br>  Yes, sir.<br>  [dramatic music playing.]<br>  [Burnham.]<br> I can't do nothing.<br>  You're the only person who'd say yes to going on an unsanctioned mission.<br>  If I'm right about this,  I'll be bringing back proof about what caused the Burn.<br>  You're far too smart not to realize you're dropping Saru in the fire.<br>  He's trying to prove his legitimacy,  and his Number One is running all around the galaxy, disobeying direct orders,  which has a very familiar ring.<br>  I'd rather regret something I did than something I didn't.<br>  Now we're getting somewhere.<br>  Are you in or out?  - Georgiou? - You had me at "unsanctioned mission.<br>"  [theme music playing.]<br>  Hunhau is an M-class planet.<br>  Sparsely populated.<br> Looks like they mainly salvage ships.<br>  Just so I'm clear, what is our primary objective?  The black box.<br>  And Book.<br>  So, what does this cat-loving friend have  that made you fall for him like a 2-year-old on the edge of a well?  Excuse me?  The Tyler thing ended in disaster.<br> Surprise, surprise.<br>  So, I get why you wouldn't want to have feelings for the blob whisperer.<br>  I don't have feelings for the blob whisperer.<br>  - And Tranceworms aren't blobs.<br> - I was referring to the cat.<br>  And you seem to know this ship pretty intimately.<br>  I spent a lot of time here.<br>  I didn't love here or anything.<br> I had my own ship.<br>  - What? - You said, "Love here.<br>"  I said, "Live here.<br>"  - Love here.<br> - You're not qualified to judge.<br>  Your emotional spectrum runs from cranky to homicidal.<br>  And why are you bringing up Tyler, anyway?  San?  It's raising my heart rate.<br> I don't even need this caffeine now.<br>  Espresso.<br>  [echoing.]<br> Do you want an espresso?  No.<br>  Philippa?  What is going on? I know something's happening with you.<br>  [console trilling.]<br>  - [Georgiou.]<br> Looks like a war zone.<br> - [Burnham.]<br> It was caused by the Burn.<br>  I've seen these ship graveyards all over.<br>  The populated area's shielded, I can't get a lock on Book's life sign.<br>  We're being hailed.<br>  This planet's a private salvage yard.<br>  Why don't you get our gear?  What are you doing here?  I must be here to buy some salvage, meatsack.<br>  All buyers go to the local Bajoran exchange.<br>  I'm not interested in getting ripped off by an avatar.<br> You insult me.<br>  My servant and I are transporting down.<br>  Do that and my auto-defense systems will take you out.<br>  I decide who's authorized to land and when.<br>  You don't look smart enough to run this dump.<br>  How soon before your boss finds out  I have real dilithium onboard I am willing to part with  and you're making me hover like a peasant?  Hang on.<br>  - Real dilithium? - What did I just say? Imbecile.<br>  You want to let this prize go?  You don't think your boss is watching you? I am losing my patience.<br>  - Well - Form a sentence!  All right.<br>  You're cleared to land.<br> But I've got my eyes on you.<br>  I don't care about your eyes unless they were dangling from my belt.<br>  - Really? - He is a bully.<br>  They crumble like a cookie when they meet a bigger one.<br>  What is that?  Cat collar.<br> To find Grudge if she got lost.<br>  That cat can't get lost.<br> It's got its own gravitational pull.<br>  Book never went anywhere without the receiver.<br>  So, I reverse-engineered it.<br> What he used to find her will now find him.<br>  The things we do for love.<br>  Let's just find what we're here to find, before I strangle you.<br>  [Grudge meowing.]<br>  Grudge?  Hello.<br>  [lighthearted music playing.]<br>  On my bed.<br>  Hey there, partner.<br>  Pick you up.<br>  Just full disclosure, I'm not a cat person.<br>  You're gonna have to go back in the box.<br>  Computer, locate Burnham.<br>  [computer.]<br> Commander Burnham is not onboard.<br>  Did you eat her?  Computer, scan Shuttlebay for Cleveland Booker's ship.<br>  Unable to locate.<br>  Come here, kitty.<br>  Come.<br>  No, no, no.<br>  No, no, no.<br> Grudge.<br> [chuckles.]<br>  You gotta come here, bud.<br> You gotta go back in the box.<br>  I don't like you.<br>  [dramatic music playing.]<br>  [Burnham.]<br> Book said he already found a black box,  but if you see any others while we're down there, grab them.<br>  [Georgiou.]<br> Out from under the idiot's nose? Child's play.<br>  No merchandise until I get your dilithium.<br>  You don't get your weapons back until you leave.<br>  If I wanted to kill you, I wouldn't need a weapon.<br>  And from the looks of this place, they'd name a holiday after me.<br>  Who put you in charge?  I'm Osyraa's nephew.<br> This is her territory.<br>  - What makes you think? - What makes you think?  Don't tell me you have actual brain matter or whatever nephews have.<br>  [Burnham.]<br> Where do you get your help from? All these people.<br> Beta 6?  Marin-Jira?  They owe Osyraa.<br>  They work for us forever.<br> It's pretty simple.<br>  I'd love to meet this Osyraa.<br> She sounds like my kind of girl.<br>  We're going over there.<br>  She's looking for self-sealing stem bolts from the late 24th century.<br>  Down there.<br>  Hang a right at the entrance.<br> Next to the plasma coils.<br>  You should be able to find what you're looking for.<br>  I'm particularly interested in any pre-2400 items.<br>  These ships are old as dirt.<br> There's plenty of good scrap in them.<br>  Here.<br>  Please.<br> Half of those parts didn't even exist in that era.<br>  Now, this has all its original parts, 930 years old and still works.<br>  Don't touch.<br>  [man 1.]<br> Move it.<br>  -
