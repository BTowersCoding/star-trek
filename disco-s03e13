Hugh?  - Adira? - Oh, my God.<br>  What are you doing here?  - Well, um, I brought medicine.<br> - How?  I hid it in my mouth.<br>  We heard you on board, so I knew I'd be landing in a holo.<br>  What happened to Discovery? Has Osyraa gone?  Are they here? Is Paul okay?  I-I don't know.<br> I didn't exactly ask permission to come.<br>  I can't believe you did this.<br>  Yeah, well, I had to do something.<br>  Here.<br>  Will these heal you?  No, but they will buy us some time.<br>  - You found them.<br> - Yeah.<br>  Not a moment too soon, looks like.<br>  Gray?  You  you-you see me?  The holo it recognizes you.<br>  Hi.<br>  I-I'd forgotten what  H-Hi.<br>  You do have kind eyes.<br>  Told you.<br>  Take Adira and Gray.<br>  Continue to search for a way to exit the holo.<br>  The medicine has bought us some time,  but we have only a few hours left, at most.<br>  And we must make contact with Discovery, wherever they are.<br>  Voyager, you're gonna  take the lead on the Viridian.<br>  Fire when ready.<br>  On my mark, all other vessels, fire on Discovery.<br>  What about the message it sends?  That spore drive is how we reconnect  with all the worlds we've lost.<br>  If Osyraa reaches them first  the Federation is done for.<br>  - Open fire.<br> - Firing, sir.<br>  Tell the Viridian to increase firepower.<br>  Get us out of here.<br>  Copy that.<br>  Reroute auxiliary power to shields.<br>  Fire at target location bearing three-six degrees alpha.<br>  - But that's their - Their primary shield emitter  disguised as a secondary deflector array.<br>  Yes, Osyraa.<br>  She knows about our shield emitter.<br>  - How long can it hold? - Five minutes, at most.<br>  Tell the fleet to hit them harder.<br>  Give them everything we got.<br>  - Aurellio, is the truth serum ready? - Yes, Osyraa.<br>  You are taking us to that dilithium planet, Cleveland.<br>  Find your own path through that nebula.<br>  I'm not telling you a damn thing.<br>  That's what everyone says and then they sing  like an Alcorian sorrowhawk.<br>  Ready a course for Base 755,  have reinforcements meet us there.<br>  Inform them that our alliance was refused.<br>  I want the Federation obliterated.<br>  I take it you saw Stamets' escape pod.<br> Mm.<br>  My team will find a way to make the spore drive work.<br>  And thanks to your special friend,  we will have plenty of dilithium.<br>  Sir, I'm getting reports of a firefight on deck seven.<br>  Hostiles are advancing, heading to the bridge.<br>  What can I say? We are Starfleet.<br>  Get him to sickbay.<br>  Tell Aurellio to be quick about it and send a message:  all regulators to decks five and above immediately.<br>  Aah!  Turbolift around the corner in 15 meters.<br>  Clear!  Flank left.<br> I got right.<br>  They're retreating.<br>  Where are they going?  - What is that? - What the hell?  Is that wind?  Life support shutoff imminent.<br>  Turbolift! Go, go, go, go, go!  Life support disengaged.<br>  Decks six through 18 sealed.<br>  Life support was shut off on Discovery's lower decks.<br>  Vents are open, air's leaking out, slowly.<br>  - Is there anyone down there? - Can't tell, sir.<br>  Life signs are still scrambled.<br>  It's got to be the crew.<br>  Seems Osyraa plans to take her time killing them.<br>  We lose shields in 60 seconds, Admiral.<br>  Stop shooting! Please, sir, cease fire.<br>  Captain Saru is trapped in the nebula.<br>  We need to force our way back onto Discovery.<br>  They can't jump without me.<br>  We can't risk sending you back.<br>  It's not just Captain Saru, sir.<br>  We lose shields in 30 seconds.<br>  I know, but Commander Burnham did the right thing.<br>  - Get him to the Foresight.<br> - Admiral  No, you're the only one that can operate the spore drive.<br>  You're going with the civilian emergency transport  as far away from here as possible.<br>  - Listen! - Believe me, I know what you're sacrificing here.<br>  - I'm sorry.<br> - No Let go of me!  Our shields are going down, sir.<br>  Prepare to pursue.<br>  Warning: outer shield breach.<br>  Nearest Chain base is 755.<br>  We're being hailed.<br>  Audio only.<br> It's Ni'Var, sir.<br>  Coming in at maximum warp.<br> They sent a fleet.<br>  They say they're here to help.<br>  Ni'Var Razors are blocking our way out of the shield, sir.<br>  Tell the Viridian to deploy its cache of pesticides.<br>  Target shuttle bays, intakes and airlocks.<br>  Stop.<br> Don't.<br>  I'll take to Admiral Vance.<br> I'll get him to stand down.<br>  I'm a little busy for games right now.<br>  Ni'Var is here because of me.<br>  They trust me.<br> Vance trusts me.<br>  All the more reason why I cannot.<br>  You're outnumbered and outgunned.<br>  You have nothing to lose.<br>  Hail him.<br>  - Admiral.<br> - Minister Osyraa.<br>  Whatever you're about to ask me  We hailed you at my request, sir.<br>  You need to let us go.<br>  Says the hostage with a phaser to her head.<br>  Didn't you send the distress call to Ni'Var?  I did, but we don't need to escalate this.<br>  - If you let us go - Discovery is far too valuable.<br>  Not without Commander Stamets.<br>  Sir, I know we haven't always seen eye to eye,  but you can trust me.<br>  You can trust us.<br>  We won't let you down.<br>  I won't let you down.<br>  Let us go.<br>  Well, that went well.<br>  Ready torpedoes.<br>  Fire at the pesticide cache  as soon as the Viridian releases it.<br>  The contaminated shrapnel will make short work  of any ships within range.<br>  Sir, Federation ships are backing off.<br>  Now turn life support back on.<br>  I'll get my crew to stand down, too.<br>  They had their chance.<br>  Maximum warp.<br>  And get her the hell off my bridge.<br>  It has helped your face, the kelp.<br>  I knew it would work.<br>  Ah.<br>  More wounds will appear.<br>  Perhaps I could explain over a meal.<br>  We can prepare it together.<br>  Um, are you familiar with sÃ Ã¬-nÃºÃ¹-lem?  SÃ Ã¬-nÃºÃ¹-lem is a traditional food from Kaminar.<br>  I've always wanted to make it,  but the holos don't give good instructions.<br>  I would be happy to teach you.<br>  We have enough wood for a small fire.<br>  But how do you know how to make it?  I learned from my father.<br>  Those are among the most  precious memories of my childhood,  that time with him.<br>  And serving it to my mother and sister.<br>  I've never seen a human holo eat sÃ Ã¬-nÃºÃ¹-lem.<br>  I know it must be confusing.<br>  But things are not always as they appear.<br>  I am not as-as I appear.<br>  In fact, I'm-I'm much like you.<br>  I am Kelpien.<br>  I'm a courier, Doc, I know all about microdosing.<br>  The effects aren't always immediate.<br>  He's built immunity.<br> Give me the neural lock.<br>  - I'm not putting the neural lock - Give-give me  - the neural lock! - I will not put the neural lock  So you went all the way to Hunhau  to save him from my nephew,  and then to Kwejian to help his family.<br>  I want that dilithium.<br>  Be persuasive.<br> Or you're next.<br>  Get the flight path from our logs.<br>  Or did my crew erase it before you could  pull them from the bridge?  I think I might actually like you.<br>  Give Zareh the neural lock.<br>  Osyraa, please, my serum will work.<br>  Sure, he's docile now, but  Violence is not necessary.<br>  Why don't we test that theory?  Mr.<br> Booker's empathic nature would make it excruciating.<br>  Now is not the time for soft hearts.<br>  You saved me.<br> You have saved others.<br>  I know your heart.<br>  Orion hearts have six valves.<br>  Blood flows in both directions.<br>  They are so much more complex than human hearts.<br>  I won't let it happen, Osyraa.<br>  I am genuinely fond of you.<br>  But make no mistake,  I saved you because you're useful to me.<br>  And even when that ceases to be the case,  the bond we have means that you and your family can  live comfortably in a location of your choosing.<br>  Break that bond again and you won't wake up next time.<br>  Book  He will die from sheer agony.<br>  Have you ever seen that before?  Make the smart choice.<br>  Book, listen to me.<br> I've got you.<br>  No, you don't.<br>  This is what's called a no-win situation.<br>  I don't believe in those.<br>  Well, then, you still have a lot to learn.<br>  How can you be Kelpien?  You don't look like me.<br>  The holo changes things sometimes.<br>  Makes them appear different,  or-or places them where they do not belong.<br>  Surely you've noticed.<br>  Long ago, that door led only to Kaminar.<br>  Now it sometimes leads to other worlds.<br>  What else do you know of the Federation worlds?  Were you ever taught that they were outside?  You want to talk about outside again.<br>  I do not like that.<br>  May I ask why?  The holos said the Federation would come for me,  from outside.<br>  If outside exists,  why didn't they come?  The Federation wanted to come.<br>  Wanting is not the same as doing.<br>  Something happened,  which prevented long-distance travel for many years.<br>  What happened?  - It was long ago.<br> - What happened?  It is complicated.<br>  Tell me!  Please, please, Su'Kal,  be calm.<br>  This is my life.<br>  I need to understand.<br>  Warp drives malfunctioned.<br>  It was called the Burn.<br>  It affected everyone, not just the Federation.<br>  But the important thing is  we are here now.<br>  And we are because your mother reached out.<br>  My mother?  She created this world  to keep you safe.<br>  But she never intended  you should live here forever.<br>  Wait.<br>  Stop!  Tell him to give me what I need.<br>  This man has stamina,  but won't last much longer.<br>  Just FYI.<br>  Well, let him catch his breath.<br>  Book  All of this  unpleasantry  can end, you know.<br>  Your friends will be unconscious  in less than 30 minutes  and dead within the hour.<br>  The Federation is a-is a shell of itself,  just going through the motions.<br>  You can't save any of them.<br>  But  you can save him.<br>  Do you really want to wake up tomorrow morning  having lost everything?  Maximum intensity.<br>  Okay, stop, stop! I'll talk to him! Just stop.<br>  Stop.<br>  Get your hands off me.<br>  Stick close to her.<br>  Book, I'm here.<br>  Michael  don't ask me.<br>  I'm sorry for the pain you've had to endure.<br>  And I'm sorry that it's about to get worse.<br>  Medical emergency.<br>  - Quarantine activated.<br> - Turn it off!  Get this damn force field down.<br>  - I'm working on it.<br> - Come on! Come on!  You good?  Come on.<br> Let's go.<br>  Hey, any luck with the emergency backup?  Let you know in one minute.<br>  Give the oxygen to Keyla.<br>  No, hey, you can't help if you're not conscious.<br>  I was holding my breath for at least ten minutes  by the time I was eight years old.<br>  I didn't know that.<br>  At home we'd freedive  for abalone in the Ogbunike caves.<br>  It was as much for tradition as for sustenance.<br>  Or that's how it was, anyway.<br>  Bad news.<br>  There's no way to bypass Emerald Chain command functions.<br>  What about a hard reboot?  We'd have to be able to access the data core in person.<br>  So we're gonna have to fight until our last breath.<br>  All personnel, code red, deck five.<br>  It's Michael.<br>  Can't you just beam us somewhere?  Transport jammer.<br> We're all on foot.<br>  Damn adrenaline.<br>  When's my heart meant to slow down?  With what we're about to do, not anytime soon.<br>  Sounds ominous.<br>  Let's just say it'll make Sigma Ten feel like a vacation.<br>  Definitely ominous, then.<br>  You stole a regulator badge?  Sure did.<br>  Regulator ID: Green 512.<br>  - Computer, open a ship-wide channel.<br> - Channel open.<br>  It wasn't a particularly happy birthday.<br>  But I found you.<br>  We played seven-card stud and drank synthehol.<br>  Too bad we didn't have fireworks.<br>  Nothing stops a party like fireworks.<br>  Who's she talking to?  Me.<br>  I assume someone will be able to make sense of that?  Yeah.<br>  Now we just got to get to the data core.<br>  Then let's take back this ship.<br>  - Clear here.<br> - clear here.<br>  Last year, I was, um, I was going through a hard time.<br>  I got off my shift and I just hid in a nacelle,  just waiting for the day to pass.<br>  But she found me.<br>  She brought cards and synthehol,  and we played poker and drank  until 0000 hours.<br>  She didn't wish me happy birthday once.<br>  She wants us to go to a nacelle.<br>  The magnetic fields are affected  by extreme heat, so  if we could set off a a thermochemical bomb  in between superconductors  holding Discovery to its nacelles.<br>  So that we'll temporarily break the magnetic seal.<br>  Yeah, that'll knock us out of warp.<br>  And our allies will be able to catch up to us.<br>  But the magnetic field could destroy the DOTs  before they could even set the bomb.<br>  That's why we have to do it ourselves.<br>  It's a suicide mission.<br>  We can die here or we can die  stopping Osyraa and saving the Federation.<br>  But that is up to you.<br>  Each of you.<br>  I'll go get the chemicals.<br>  I'll start on the fuse.<br>  Su'Kal.<br>  Kaminar is empty.<br>  The holos are all gone.<br>  Where did they go?  Kaminar was never through that door.<br>  It is an entire world.<br>  There there are many worlds  and many individuals.<br> Not only holos.<br>  I am sentient.<br>  Just as you are.<br>  You must sense it.<br>  That we are different from the holos.<br>  I've always felt different.<br>  Yes.<br>  Uh, like you, I have been at a crossroads.<br>  I've had to choose between  leaving the only world I had ever known  or staying.<br>  And I, too, was afraid.<br>  But you said my mother built this world  to keep me safe.<br>  Outside can be challenging.<br>  Dangerous?  But it is also beautiful and diverse  and filled with wonder.<br>  All that you have learned here  was meant to help you understand it.<br>  See me.<br>  It's back  the creature that chases me.<br>  - Su'Kal, it came from the folktale.<br> - No.<br> No.<br>  - It is trying to help you.<br> - No.<br>  Whatever's behind that locked door,  whatever happened to make you afraid,  - you must face it or we will all die here.<br> - No.<br>  See me.<br>  No, I won't!  I need to find the elder.<br>  Hello? We are the anticipated input.<br>  We've come for the child.<br>  You said the Vulcan holo  was showing its underlying programming.<br>  Maybe it's already fritzed out.<br>  Or got lost in that.<br>  Those are the edges of the holo.<br>  The ship would be just beyond that.<br>  We should check it out,  see how badly the hull's compromised.<br>  I tried.<br> I got sick right away.<br>  The radiation in there is definitely worse.<br>  I could go.<br>  - Gray - I  I'm not actually corporeal, remember?  Radiation can't hurt me.<br>  How could Su'Kal have caused the Burn?  I How is that even possible?  I can't prove it without a scan,  but I suspect he's a polyploid.<br>  That's when normal chromosomal separation  is disrupted in utero.<br> It can  cause an individual's genes to be affected  by their environment,  and this environment has massive  concentrations of dilithium.<br>  Not to mention whatever's outside.<br>  You think Su'Kal's  genetically connected to dilithium?  I think his genes have mutated to allow his body  to interact with dilithium in unique ways, yes.<br>  Well, dilithium has a subspace component.<br>  Uh, does that-does that mean he'd have a genetic connection  to subspace, too?  That would explain a lot.<br>  Did anything unusual happen on board  before you beamed down here?  Yeah, our-our warp core reacted to something,  uh, a subspace radiation surge.<br>  - Why? - Su'Kal got upset.<br>  He screamed and the entire ground shook.<br>  Sound is-is a mechanical wave.<br>  Its energy travels through a medium.<br>  - Like subspace.<br> - His scream must have  traveled at the resonant frequency  of-of dilithium's subspace components.<br>  That's what hit our warp core.<br>  So whatever frightened him 125 years ago  must have been infinitely worse than what happened to him today.<br>  That's what caused the Burn.<br>  Can we stop the Burn from happening again?  If we can get him away from all of this dilithium, I think so.<br>  The ship's falling apart.<br>  Shields won't hold for much longer.<br>  If Su'Kal has answers,  we need them.<br> Like, now.<br>  Ah, Su'Kal.<br>  The elder's gone.<br>  I am so sorry.<br>  His absence can only reflect  how severely this world is degrading.<br>  We must go, Su'Kal.<br>  I saw outside once.<br>  When I was so very small.<br> It was  Terrifying.<br>  The elder read stories to me.<br>  They calmed me.<br> They made me feel safe.<br>  I do not have him now.<br>  You have us.<br>  You have me.<br>  Please, Su'Kal,  take us to that room.<br>  Whatever is inside,  it is time to see.<br>  Why can't the nacelles be closer?  We're almost to the access point.<br>  Hang in there.<br>  Here.<br>  I don't think I can get up.<br>  You have to try.<br>  Both of you.<br>  Owo, you have to go by yourself.<br>  Take the oxygen.<br>  What?  No.<br> You'll suffocate.<br>  We're just delaying the inevitable.<br>  You have to finish the mission.<br>  Please.<br>  I love you all.<br>  - How much longer do you need? - Two minutes.<br>  How about 15 seconds?  Anytime.<br>  - It hasn't even been 15 seconds.<br> - Come on!  Go, go, go!  Got it.<br>  Open that door!  I won't be able to override the system in time.<br>  We can't move.<br>  Plan B, then?  Negative contact.<br>  Negative, negative, we got nothing.<br> All clear, deck eight.<br>  Up here, you son of a bitch.<br>  Aah!  - You okay? - Yeah.<br>  But I have to get out of here.<br> We're running out of time.<br>  I have an idea.<br> Cover me!  Michael!  Processing.<br>  Come on.<br>  - Processing.<br> - Aw, come on.<br>  - Come on! - Coordinates accepted.<br>  Yes!  You have arrived at the data core.<br>  I'd have come here, too.<br> Smart.<br>  Your approval means everything to me.<br>  Adrenaline wearing off?  Nope.<br>  Nacelle doors open.<br>  Warning.<br>  Oxygen depleted.<br>  Warning: nacelle breach.<br>  Warning: nacelle breach.<br>  Warning: nacelle breach.<br>  Lieutenant Owosekun.<br>  You can't be here.<br>  The magnetic field.<br>  You must stand.<br>  Status report!  Something's knocked us out of warp.<br>  Tell the Viridian to pull us in.<br> We are not losing this ship.<br>  Who do you think  is gonna make the bigger stain down there,  you, or that fat cat of yours?  She's a queen!  It doesn't have to be like this.<br>  I already tried with Vance.<br>  I won't make that mistake again.<br>  Yeah, well  unlike you  I never quit.<br>  Computer, this is Michael Burnham,  Commander, USS Discovery.<br>  Reset all primary and secondary systems.<br>  Authorization code Burnham Gamma six-zero-two Epsilon Echo.<br>  System check.<br>  System check.<br>  System check.<br>  Reboot complete, Commander Burnham.<br>  Yes!
