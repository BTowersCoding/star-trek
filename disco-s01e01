GEORGIOU: Hey, I taught you that.<br>  You don't trust me, Captain?  I trust you with my life, Commander Burnham,  but it doesn't change the fact that you're lost.<br>  Very lost.<br>  Technically, we would be lost.<br>  How long until that storm  comes crashing down on us?  I estimate one hour,  17 minutes, 22 seconds.<br>  Which is why I've made sure we're not lost.<br>  The map says the well is this way, Captain.<br>  (THUNDER RUMBLING)  BURNHAM: This drought's going to last 89 years.<br>  The Crepusculans are facing extinction as a species.<br>  See those egg sacs?  Those are their offspring.<br>  GEORGIOU: They've survived here for over a thousand years, Michael.<br>  Right, and if we don't do something now,  they won't live another thousand hours.<br>  The ambient radiation  from a nearby drilling accident dried out their water table.<br>  If we can get in and out without making contact,  we can steer clear of General Order One.<br>  And there is the well.<br>  I stand corrected.<br>  Ye of little faith.<br>  Oh, never had a doubt.<br>  Tell me what I need to break through this bedrock.<br>  .<br>7-second field burst at level setting 13.<br>5.<br>  (PHASER WHIRS)  (DISTANT BOOM)  (THUNDER CRACKS)  (RUMBLING)  Georgiou to Shenzhou.<br>  Two to transport.<br>  (COMM STATIC)  (THUNDER CRASHING)  BURNHAM: The storm is moving faster than I thought.<br>  The ship won't be able to pick up our signatures.<br>  Unless we can contact Lieutenant Saru,  we could be trapped here until it's over.<br>  Let's take a walk.<br>  (CREATURE CHITTERING)  (CHITTERING)  Follow my footsteps, Michael, even lines.<br>  Why? Captain, where are we going?  It's your turn to trust me, Number One.<br>  But now we're really lost.<br>  We're far too small to be seen with the naked eye.<br>  And you can't set a course without a star.<br>  Is it wise to be heading  - away from the village? - It's hard to imagine  you've served under me for seven years.<br>  I think it's time  that we talked about you having your own command.<br>  I'm grateful, Captain.<br>  Though I would be significantly more so  if I thought we had any chance of ever returning to the ship.<br>  Just keep walking, Michael.<br>  What will you do  if you were stuck here for 89 years?  A likely scenario  unless we die here in the desert.<br>  But say you lived.<br>  As a xenoanthropologist, I could reveal myself  to the natives, learn their culture,  try to fit in if possible.<br>  And you, Captain?  What will you do if we're trapped here for 89 years?  That's easy.<br> I'd escape.<br>  These are our footprints.<br>  You've walked us in a circle.<br>  Not exactly a circle.<br>  (THUNDERING)  (WHOOSHING)  How did they find us?  I set a star.<br>  (METALLIC TRILLING)           (ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS)    BURNHAM: First Officer's Log, Stardate 1207.<br>3.<br>  On Earth, it's May 11, 2256,  a Sunday.<br>  The crew of the U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Shenzhou  has been called to the edge of Federation space  to investigate damage done to one of our interstellar relays.<br>  Blast burns around the hole are inconclusive.<br>  Were they caused by an asteroid,  or was it deliberately destroyed  to limit Starfleet communications?  And if so, by whom?  Despite the risks of our mission,  I remain optimistic.<br>  It's hard not to be in the face of such beauty  in this case, a binary star system.<br>  Around these two suns,  ice, dust and gasses collide  to form the planets future generations will call home.<br>  A humbling reminder that all life  is born from chaos and destruction.<br>  SARU: Based on initial readings,  I would say the relay doesn't appear  to have been damaged naturally.<br>  I don't like the look of that.<br>  Well, keep looking.<br>  Well, the comment was figurative;  I'm expressing concern.<br>  Finish your scans so you can express facts instead.<br>  BURNHAM: The bridge is yours, Mr.<br> Saru.<br>  SARU: Yes  Commander.<br>  Yes, Number One.<br>  Your chief science officer is worried.<br>  Something took a bite out of our relay.<br>  Saru thinks it was malicious.<br>  Saru's Kelpien he thinks everything's malicious.<br>  What do you think?  Any idea what it is?  By all indications, nothing intelligent.<br>  But?  Starfleet's reputation for tech hygiene is exemplary.<br>  When a relay goes down,  the Federation sends a ship to fix it.<br>  You think someone's trying to get our attention?  If they are, they have.<br>  Lieutenant Saru, what do we have?  Ah.<br> I have taken the initiative of keeping us  at maximum scanning distance  in case of anything threatening out there, Captain.<br>  Yes.<br> Number One tells me you suspect foul play.<br>  Despite the first officer's constant need  to dismiss my ideas  She apparently agrees with you.<br>  Really?  GEORGIOU: I'm shocked as well.<br>  Ensign Connor,  agreement between my senior officers.<br>  Note the date and time.<br>  Noted, Captain.<br>  BURNHAM: Is this amount of sarcasm  always necessary?  Necessary? No.<br>  - But I do like it.<br> - (BEEPING)  SARU: There is something else out there.<br>  What do you have, Saru?  Recalibrating sensors.<br>  CONNOR: Electronic alignment in process.<br>  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  SARU: Active scans are being deflected.<br>  I'm having trouble locating the source.<br>  So something's out there,  but no one can tell me where or what it is.<br>  SARU: Ah, wait.<br>  I have it.<br>  (BEEPING)  No.<br> Recalibrating.<br>  GEORGIOU: Any time now, Mr.<br> Saru.<br>  I have it.<br>  GEORGIOU: Magnify.<br>  Is that what damaged our relay?  What am I looking at?  Object of unknown origin.<br>  Let's get more specific.<br>  I'm unable to bring it into focus.<br>  Number One?

Thoughts, Number One?  With such little data, I'd prefer not to speculate.<br>  Oh, I will.<br> It's lurking.<br>  The scattering field it's emitting suggests intent.<br>  We see something we don't understand  and instantly cast judgment?

Next time, you might try not disturbing  the property of a warrior race  we've hardly spoken to for a hundred years.<br>  Our only choice now is to navigate this situation  with as much finesse as possible.<br>  Admiral, if I may.<br>  The ideal outcome for any Klingon interaction is battle.<br>  They're relentlessly hostile, sir.<br>  It's in their nature.<br>  The Federation and the Klingon Empire  have always been on the cold side of war.<br>  We've had only fleeting run-ins with them for a century.<br>  And now you presume  to know their motivation  because it is "in their nature"?
