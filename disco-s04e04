                    			1 Previously on Star Trek: Discovery  The killer is a Ni'Var citizen  and a Qowat Milat nun known as J'Vini.<br>  Starfleet remands the prisoner  to your custody for extradition to Ni'Var.<br>  BURNHAM: First officer of the Credence.<br>  He had two kids.<br>  Then you know they deserved justice.<br>  I also know bringing Ni'Var into the Federation  will benefit millions.<br>  There must have been a sign it was coming.<br>  I missed it.<br>  What you require is freedom from guilt.<br>  My mind to your mind.<br>  It can be a little hard to get out of your comfort zone  when you can barely get out of the lab.<br>  So getting the opportunity to do this,  this could be really good for me.<br>  ADIRA: Are you you?  I'm definitely me.<br>  (CHUCKLES): How do you feel?  Whole.<br>  BURNHAM: Captain's log, stardate 865661.<br>2.<br>  It's been a week since my mission with the Qowat Milat.<br>  Since then we've stayed in orbit over Ni'Var,  working with the Ni'Var Science Institute  and the Federation Task Force  that's tracking and studying the DMA.<br>  No other inhabited worlds have been threatened yet,  but of course that can change at any moment.<br>  Ni'Var has fast-tracked negotiations  to rejoin the Federation.<br>  I haven't yet heard how they're going.<br>  We're all living in uncertainty.<br>  Even for a crew as familiar with the unknown as this one,  the stress is taking its toll.<br>  I'm following Dr.<br> Culber's advice,  mandating downtime to help  with their psychological and emotional well-being.<br>  But Stamets won't let himself slow down, even for a second.<br>  He wants to solve this for all of us, especially Book.<br>  Book.<br>  Even though the mind meld with T'Rina helped at the time,  the peace he felt has been  fleeting.<br>  I've encouraged him to talk to Dr.<br> Culber,  but I feel him pulling into himself.<br>  A natural response to grief, crisis,  all of this.<br>  But he can't do this alone.<br>  None of us can.<br>  SARU: Captain, President Rillak has requested  our presence on Ni'Var.<br>  For the summit with President T'rina?  Negotiations are coming to a close.<br>  Uh, but Admiral Vance has fallen ill  with what I am told is a Malindian stomach worm.<br>  The accepted medical guidance is  to allow the worm to gestate before extraction.<br>  - Mm.<br> How long will that take? - 24 hours.<br>  We are to replace him in his diplomatic capacity.<br>  I would love to be there  when Ni'Var officially rejoins the Federation,  but DMA analysis has to take priority.<br>  I'm sure she doesn't need both of us.<br>  Well, to clarify, President Rillak did not imply  a choice in the matter.<br>  Did she brief you on how exactly  we're meant to participate?  Oh, we are to, and I quote,  "Remain silent and look official, nothing more".<br>  I still feel lost.<br>  Your time with the Qowat Milat wasn't helpful?  No, it was.<br>  They have this whole "absolute candor" thing.<br>  So I kind of tried that on myself.<br>  And?  It's  It's like, you know, all these years,  I think I have been on the straight-line path  to the captain's chair  and just trying to get there as fast as I could.<br>  But now I think maybe  Maybe you need to take a detour?  (STAMMERS) Yeah.<br> I have been trying  to step outside my comfort zone.<br>  I hunted down a nun.<br>  I ate foods that I hate.<br>  Have you ever tried Rigelian rutabagas?  Because they are horrible, so don't, seriously.<br>  But these are like little baby steps,  and I feel like I really need to challenge myself.<br>  Maybe I could volunteer in Astrometrics,  or study medicine?  I don't know.<br> Seems to make you happy.<br>  (CHUCKLES)  It might be a good idea to clear your mind  before you make any choices.<br>  That is that is exactly the problem.<br>  My mind doesn't clear.<br> And then now  with all this DMA craziness going on,  it's like  You know, Dr.<br> Kovich came to me,  looking for a Discovery crew member  to lead some cadets in a team-building exercise.<br>  He's consulting with Starfleet Academy.<br>  Believes we have something special to offer  since we served in a time before the Burn.<br>  How would I justify bailing on Commander Stamets  to go lead an exercise?  The captain's requiring everyone to take some downtime.<br>  This would count as yours.<br>  Go.<br> Get inspired.<br>  Okay.<br>  Mm, here's hoping.<br>  You know, come to think of it,  can you do me a favor when you go?  Why is Tilly ordering me to go on a training exercise  for cadets?  I'm already an ensign.<br>  Starfleet Academy is awesome.<br>  (CHUCKLES)  Try and think of it  as part of your responsibility as host.<br>  Your supposed to add new experiences to your symbiont.<br>  Yeah, but Jovar taught at the Academy before the Burn.<br>  So, really, Tal's already got that experience.<br>  GRAY: There's always something new to learn.<br>  And besides, orders are orders.<br>  All right.<br> Well, what are you gonna do today?  You know, other than the zhian'tal exercises.<br>  Mind and body connection is everything,  especially when you have a new body.<br>  But then I really want to check out  the crew games they're planning in the forward lounge.<br>  You barely know anyone.<br>  I'll walk in, say hello.<br>  Now I know someone.<br> Easy.<br>  You'll do the same with the cadets.<br>  I'm sorry, have you met me?

Here comes the other one.<br>  - They're coming right at us! - Keep firing.<br>  ADIRA: Armstrong, acknowledge.<br> Please acknowledge.<br>  IMAHARA: This is Captain Imahara of the U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Armstrong.<br>  - It's them! - Armstrong, get us the hell out of here!  Armstrong!  (INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER)  MAN (OVER P.<br>A.<br>): Ensign Moore, please report to briefing room seven.<br>  Ensign Moore,  - briefing room seven.<br> - I just finished reading  the Armstrong's report.<br>  The loss of Lieutenant Callum is a tragedy.<br>  Frankly, I'm-I'm amazed any of you survived.<br>  Well, the cadets really pulled it together  when it mattered.<br>  Honestly, any of them would be  an excellent addition to any crew.<br>  And when that opportunity comes,  they'll have you to thank for it.<br>  You know, when Discovery first arrived,  no one here trusted you.<br>  It wasn't just that you were in a 930-year-old starship  and had never heard of the Burn,  it was the way you carried yourselves,  like you grew up in a world that believes  anything is possible.<br>  Quite frankly, it-it stung.<br>  And is exactly what this new generation  of cadets needs as the Federation rebuilds.<br>  Well, after what you've just endured,  I can understand that an offer to teach at the Academy  is unlikely to fall on willing ears,  but the opening is there.<br>  Anytime.<br>  Thank you, sir.<br>  I never thought that I'd say this,  but I think that I'm glad I came.<br>  I-I just I  I think I might have actually made some friends today.<br>  I wish I knew how to do it  without nearly getting eaten by a blob,  but  You know, you are one of the most brilliant people  that I have ever met.<br>  Do you ever wonder why you start with "I can't"  when it comes to making new connections?  - Just seems kind of impossible.<br> - Well,  when I see you, and I see everything  that you have been through  and accomplished,  you're a reminder to me that everything is possible.<br>  Welcome home, Madam President.<br>  Thank you, President Rillak.<br>  Billions of futures have been changed  thanks to what we've done here today.<br>  I must commend both of you on a job well done.<br>  Madam President, thank you for taking this first step  with the Federation.<br>  If I may,  there's a matter on my mind.<br>  You are curious about the Qowat Milat sister, J'Vini  if she will face justice for her actions?  Yes, ma'am.<br>  J'Vini will go to Pijar,  a monastic world in the Pella system.<br>  There she will devote herself to deep rehabilitative meditation  under your mother's careful guidance.<br>  They leave tonight.<br>  My mom said she had big news for me.<br>  J'Vini helped rebuild Dr.<br> Burnham's life.<br>  Now it seems their roles are reversed.<br>  In time, she will also make amends to the family  of the slain Starfleet officer.<br>  I hope this sets your mind at ease.<br>  Thank you.<br>  Captain Saru.<br>  Will you join me for tea?  It would be my pleasure.<br>  For someone who dislikes politics,  you show an aptitude for it.<br>  I assume the admiral made a miraculous recovery?  Well, now that you mention it, he was looking, well, better  last time I saw him.<br>  Hmm.<br>  I received a piece of intelligence this morning  indicating the exit clause request was coming.<br>  I had to protect my source.<br>  President T'rina.<br>  Mm-hmm.<br>  (SIGHS)  If you wanted my help, you could have just asked me.<br>  Truth be told  I wasn't sure you were the right person for the job.<br>  But I'm glad you were.<br>  I appreciate that.<br>  I know transparency isn't always possible  in your position.<br>  But it is what I need to best serve you  and the Federation.<br>  So if you could be more forthcoming in the future,  I would appreciate that as well.<br>  Understood, Captain.<br>  I will see you back at headquarters in a few days.<br>    Wow.<br>  Guess I've got a lot to work out.<br>  What do I do with it?  Well, when the mandala's finished, it's   wiped away.<br>  You do this yourself?  Are there  are there things you need to wipe away?  Sure.<br>  You want to talk about it?  Someday.<br>  - (DOOR CHIMES) - Come.<br>  I heard about what happened on the mission.<br>  How are you doing?  You know, crash into an ice moon,  stranded in an electrical storm,  chased by a flesh-melting alien, so  - typical day.<br> - (LAUGHS)  I know there's been something on your mind  We haven't really sat in here together  since you became captain.<br>  Right.<br>  Remember when we first became roomies? (LAUGHS)  I was so scared to bunk with a famous mutineer.<br>  I think I, like, I think I laid awake at night  because I was scared you were gonna, like,  knife me in the back or something.<br>  Well, you snored like crazy.<br>  - (GASPS) - I had to get the computer  to block out the frequency so I could get any sleep.<br>  So sorry!  I only blocked it out for a few days,  and then I  I kind of started liking it.<br>  Really?  - Really.<br> - You're weird.<br>  You want to go back, don't you?  I do.<br>  Why?  Because getting my lieutenant pips  was the worst day of my life.<br>  You know, I-I never could figure out  how my mother became a diplomat.<br>  She was such a hardass at home.<br>  No compromise.<br> She had everything planned out.<br>  She had my whole life planned out.<br>  So when I told her that I wanted to join Starfleet  instead of the diplomatic corps, sh  So I always thought that I was doing this for me.<br>  But then, when I got the pips  all of a sudden I realized, like,  my mom is 900 years in the past.<br>  She's never gonna see me wear them.<br>  And I started wondering  if this is what I really wanted, or if I just  really wanted to be seen.<br>  You know.<br> And that was humbling.<br>  But I think it could be a useful perspective  for a teacher.<br>  Well  - I'll miss seeing your face every day.<br> - No.<br>  It's not forever.<br> You'll still see me around  - Fed HQ.<br> - Right.<br>  And then, you know, if it's really bad,  I can get Zora to record me while I'm sleeping  so you can listen to me snoring like I know you love to do.<br>  I said I kind of liked it.<br>  You know you love it!  (BOTH LAUGHING)  Let's not get crazy.<br>          <br>
