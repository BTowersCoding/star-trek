Oh, that was close.<br>  That is why even couriers steer clear of the courier network.<br>  ETA to FHQ is 90 seconds.<br>  Up ahead.<br> Wanderer-class ship.<br>  What's left of it.<br> Not good.<br>  There's no morphing around that.<br>  Shields at 20%.<br>  Discovery just entered the gravity well.<br>  If we don't let her in, she'll be crushed against the shields.<br>  Contact in 60 seconds, sir.<br>  Open a port just big enough for Discovery to pass through.<br>  Bring her in via tractor beam to a secure location.<br>  Security team at the ready.<br> Fully armed.<br>  Sir, another ship's approaching.<br>  It's Mr.<br> Booker's.<br>  They are extending subspace.<br>  What the hell is going on here?  Commander Michael Burnham  to Federation Headquarters.<br>  Burnham to HQ.<br> Do you copy?  - Comms are fried.<br> - They're letting her in.<br>  30 seconds to the shield barrier.<br>  Osyraa did the same thing on Benthos IV.<br>  Got through the shields,  then blew up the presidential palace.<br>  We have got to get back on Discovery.<br>  Tractor beam range in 20 seconds.<br>  - Grudge secure? - We should all be so cozy.<br>  Then let's do this.<br>  Ten seconds counting down.<br>  Ten, nine,  - eight, seven - Proximity alert.<br>  Six.<br>  - Proximity alert.<br> -

Tell them to stay at the ready.<br> - Will do.<br>  Are you ready to talk to the Federation yet?  Hold them off.<br> Right now, I want to know  how the hell did a ship fly into my shuttle bay?  They got in just as shields went down, sir.<br>  You should have seen them coming and blown them out of the sky.<br>  How many life signs on board?  Can't tell.<br> Fire-suppression protocols  are blocking all sensors.<br>  My regulators are on their way.<br>  Whoever it is, I'll handle them.<br>  - I want them alive.<br> - You got it.<br>  Ah.<br>  I cannot believe this is 900-year-old technology.<br>  Nine hundred and thirty.<br>  It must have been the Golden Age of Science.<br>  It's remarkable.<br>  Tell me the greatest scientist in three sectors  has figured out how the spore drive works.<br>  Well, it is quite a puzzle.<br>  That's where the "greatest scientist" part comes in.<br>  What is clear  is that he's a conduit of some kind  for the mycelial network.<br>  But to know more,  I will need to do a bioanalysis.<br>  Is it safe to work here?  Of course.<br> Our enemies are secure.<br>  I would never let anything happen to you.<br>  You know that.<br>  But you seem worried.<br>  I'm in hostile territory,  about to take the gamble of my life.<br>  To think the Federation would hoard their technology,  but you would free us all of the yoke of dilithium.<br>  The galaxy is a much better place  with you in it, Osyraa.<br>  Work fast, old friend.<br>  We may need to jump away if things go awry.<br>  Computer.<br>  Play file 73 for Invigilator Aurellio.<br>  Thank you.<br>  The DOTs have nearly put out all the fires.<br>  We only have a few minutes before the Regulators show up.<br>  Okay.<br> Queen is safe and secure.<br>  - I found another dose of radiation meds.<br> - Oh.<br>  All right.<br>  Now we got to find Stamets.<br> Osyraa can't jump without him.<br>  You have to find Stamets.<br>  It's a concealing device.<br>  Hides the life sign from sensors.<br>  Took it off a tosser who was stealing  my cargo at the Theskian Exchange.<br>  Works like a charm.<br>  - But I've only got one.<br> - We stick together.<br>  Hey.<br> They're expecting to find a pilot in here.<br>  Once the smoke clears, they'll read our life signs,  and I don't know Discovery half as well as you.<br>  Go save the day, Michael.<br>  Is this the wrong moment to tell you  that I love you for the first time?  Not quite the first.<br>  You talk in your sleep.<br>  Okay, stay out of sight till I lead them away.<br>  I love you, too.<br>  Fan out!  I see a life sign!  On the ship.<br> Take them alive.<br>  - Any response from Booker's ship or Discovery? - No, sir.<br>  There's a transport jammer of some kind on Discovery.<br>  What's the Viridian doing?  Nothing yet, sir.<br>  Just sitting out there beyond our shields.<br>  Why would Osyraa come by herself, just her ship?  She knows part of our fleet is at Kam  All vessels, weapons hot.<br>  Prepare to fire on Discovery on my command.<br>  Sir?  Osyraa.<br>  She's not on the Viridian.<br> She's on Discovery.<br>  And we just let her in the front door.<br>  You two, back it up.<br>  No talking.<br>  If this one gives you any trouble,  you keep him alive  but make him wish otherwise.<br>  Yes, sir.<br>  Till the next time.<br>  Looking forward to it, sweetheart.<br>  Come on.<br>  - Hey.<br> - Let's go.<br>  On our way to Sector 4.<br>  Be right there.<br> Just  Hey.<br>  - Transport function unavailable.<br> - Come on.<br>  Transport function unavailable.<br>  Regulator 524, report to Deck 3.<br>  Put the fleet at Kaminar on red alert.<br>  - We should expect retaliation.<br> - Aye, sir.<br>  All ships in position, Admiral.<br>  Prepare to fire on my mark.<br>  Sir, a message from Discovery.<br>  Osyraa?  - Hold fire.<br> - Standing by.<br>  Put her through.<br>  This is Minister Osyraa of the Emerald Chain.<br>  This is Admiral Vance of the United Federation of Planets.<br>  Surrender or prepare to be fired upon.<br>  I assure you that there is no need for any of that.<br>  I apologize that I arrived under such pretenses.<br>  What do you want?  I'm here to talk.<br>  Where is Discovery's crew?  Oh, they're boarding shuttles as we speak.<br>  I'm holding on to your bridge crew,  but the others should be with you shortly.<br>  Remove your jammer, and I'll beam them over myself.<br>  That's a security allowance I am not prepared to make.<br>  But you will find them all in excellent health,  a good-faith gesture on my part.<br>  A good-faith gesture would be to let everyone go.<br>  Now, Admiral,  we both know that I need some leverage.<br>  But  if things go well and I hope they do  then you will have them all back in no time.<br>  I look forward to hearing from you.<br>  Shuttle on its way from Discovery.<br>  Have Security and Medical intercept them.<br>  And prepare the ready room.<br>  I guess we might be having a visitor.<br>  This is Team 5 Leader  Regulator Team 3,  report to the bridge, fully armed.<br>  Osyraa has left the ship,  is heading to Federation Headquarters.<br>  All others  Commander Michael Burnham broadcasting  on a secure sub-relay.<br>  Communication code Alpha-Uniform-996.<br>  Message to Gabrielle Burnham.<br>  Mayday.<br>  Emerald Chain has hijacked Discovery  and infiltrated Federation Headquarters.<br>  Mayday.<br>  Mom, they have taken over all of our systems.<br>  The way things are going   I might not see you again,  until another distant future.<br>  Maybe Dad will be there.<br>  I love you.<br>  Regulator Team 1, report to Deck 10.<br>  Regular Team 2, send an extra body over to Engineering.<br>  Invigilator Aurellio wants to take the neural lock  - off his subject.<br> - Mm.<br>  All right.<br>  Here we go, Paul.<br>  Welcome to Federation Headquarters.<br>  Where's your president?  Since this is a security situation,  the president has authorized me to negotiate with you  for the release of Discovery and its crew.<br>  Is that satisfactory to you?  Whatever gets the job done.<br>  Initiation of hostilities by Starfleet officers  will not be tolerated.<br>  But should our visitors decide to initiate hostilities,  you have permission to respond with force.<br>  Is that clear?  Aye, sir.<br>  Shall we?  Lead the way.<br>  You think we don't know you're sending messages?  Osyraa said we're not to be harmed, so  You don't want to get on her bad side, do you?  No talking.<br>  Come on.<br>  You two will get us killed.<br>  What, you worried about them or you?  - They're being juvenile.<br> - I'm not dying in here because they're bored.<br>  - Shut up! All of you! - Don't think Osyraa would really like that.<br>  -  right now.<br> - And stop!  What the hell was that tapping?  Morse code.<br>  Year one.<br> Starfleet Academy.<br>  What were you saying?  I was telling him to keep tapping.<br>  Well-played, all of you.<br>  - Computer.<br> - Access denied.<br>  Osyraa will have taken over the whole operating system by now.<br>  - Could you hack into it? - I can try.<br>  Michael's out there on her own right now.<br>  - We've got to do better than try.<br> - Use this.<br>  She's not with Dr.<br> Culber and the captain?  They're still in the nebula.<br>  Dr.<br> Culber said they wouldn't survive past four hours.<br>  Adira took radiation tablets.<br> Bought them some time.<br>  Wait, Adira's down there, too?  We got to jump right there once we take back the ship.<br>  Bryce, can you monitor comms?  - On it.<br> - Okay.<br>  Owo, Detmer, Rhys, try to get that back door open.<br>  It leads to a maintenance shaft.<br>  And the rest of us are gonna start barricading  the turbolift doors.<br>  Next regulator who tries to step through  is gonna lose a head.<br>  What's with the holo?  And why is he staring at me so intently?  It's de rigueur during negotiations  to use a biometric lie detector system.<br>  Even among allies.<br>  Where's the fun in that?  Nobody seemed to like it when a red light would just go off,  so we gave it a face.<br>  Hmm.<br>  A human face, of course.<br>  Is that a problem?  I'll get over it.<br>  I certainly do not intend to lie.<br>  She does not.<br>  Still, it's hard to begin a productive conversation  when I haven't been able to speak  to the officers on board my ship.<br>  - Um, lie detector thingy - Eli.<br>  Eli,  the bridge crew of the Discovery are safe,  and my crew have been given orders not to harm them.<br>  Aside from a few scratches and bruised egos,  everyone is fine.<br>  Bruised egos.<br>  Well  it was so easy to take the ship,  I almost thought that it was a trap at first.<br>  Then I realized Captain Saru wasn't on board,  just an ensign with the conn.<br>  Did you send Saru to Kaminar?  You said you wanted to talk.<br> Let's talk.<br>  What do you want?  I want peace.<br>  I want the Emerald Chain to unite with the Federation.<br>  Well, you're gonna have to expand on that one.<br>  Every empire falls.<br>  It would be foolish to think that we can remain  where we once were when we're out of dilithium.<br>  I'm sure that Ryn has already told you of our scarcity.<br>  He has.<br>  You have a spore drive that you cannot replicate.<br>  I have the most well-funded scientific institutions  in the known galaxy.<br>  There is a deal to be made here.<br>  You already have Discovery under your control.<br>  Why bring us into it at all?  Because the Federation,  despite its failures since the Burn,  is still a symbol of hope.<br>  The Chain, despite our efforts and our advances,  has never experienced such privilege.<br>  If we combine the best of what we are  You really think this could work?  You're a chain of planets.<br>  We are a federation of mercantile exchanges.<br>  We need to focus on doing what is for the good of our people.<br>  At the end of the day, they are what this is all about.<br>  You're proposing  a new Federation.<br>  Yeah.<br>  Tell Starfleet to back the hell off.<br> We're not stupid.<br>  I can see their vessels getting closer.<br>  - Zareh? - Yeah.<br>  We have a free agent aboard.<br>  Sensors show no unexpected life signs.<br>  They must be using some kind of concealment device.<br>  We're missing a comms badge Regulator I.<br>D.<br> Theta 431.<br>  Pulling up ship's schematics now.<br>  Hello, Theta 431.<br>  They're in a Jefferies tube, Deck 5.<br>  Backup's on the way.<br>  If you get in at sections five, seven, nine,  ten and 12, they'll be trapped.<br>  I'm gonna remove the neural locks.<br>  There's no need for such things among scientists.<br>  It makes it hard for me to ask you questions.<br>  Please do be cooperative.<br>  This is, um  Andorian opera, isn't it?  Good ear.<br>  Andorians have the best singers.<br>  Their antennae increase resonance.<br>  This particular soprano was discovered on the street corner.<br>  If you hear her live, in the right hall,  you can hear four layers of overtones.<br>  I would love to experience that.<br>  Well, someday you shall.<br>  A scientist of your talent,  I'm sure Osyraa will want you at the science institute.<br>  Do your children like opera?  My ?  The, uh, piercings behind your ear.<br>  To bless the arrival of a child.<br>  I'm guessing your partner is Orion?  Hurt like hell, but I never thought I'd have children,  so how could I say no?  Children are a blessing.<br>  I have one myself.<br>  Oh.<br> Congratulations.<br>  And I'm very concerned about them.<br>  And my partner.<br>  You communicate with the spores.<br>  That's how you navigate the mycelial network, isn't it?  His name is Hugh.<br>  He's still inside the Verubin Nebula.<br>  You must know about the radiation levels in there.<br>  I haven't seen any devices  that would augment a human to mycelium connection,  and you're not an empath,  so it must be the Tardigrade DNA in your system.<br>  The Tardigrade DNA that fused with my DNA was  from a species that is long extinct.<br>  I've tried to replicate it, but it's been corrupted.<br>  You'll probably have to kill me to extract it.<br>  Mr.<br> Stamets, I can assure you, we have other methods now.<br>  And if those methods don't work?  Ah.<br>  We will grow the Tardigrade cells.<br>  Fidelity is always the issue with replication.<br>  Growth marries the fidelity of a copy  with the vitality of new beginnings.<br>  You'll see, Mr.<br> Stamets.<br>  We will grow the Tardigrade cells.<br>  Regulator 441.<br>  I'm in the Jefferies tube at section 12.<br>  We're getting close to the communication signal.<br>  They're in Junction 24.<br>  I'm into their system.<br> What now?  See if you can scramble comms for Michael.<br>  30 seconds to contact.<br>  Hey, hero.<br>  Can you hear me?  I'm guessing right about now  you're getting a little nervous, huh?  Figuring out that we've almost got you.<br>  You could just give up.<br> Huh? Why not make it easy?  I promise you the lofty position of having  your skull be my candy dish.<br>  Come on.<br> Come on.<br>  - Warning.<br> - I see her!  - Fire.<br> - No!  Zareh, I've got her.<br>  Fire suppression protocol initiated.<br>  Oh, no.<br>  Oxygen purge initiated.<br>  System purge complete.<br>  Closing exterior vents  in five, four,  three, two,  one.<br>  Exterior vents secured.<br>  Pressure restored.<br>  Regulator 665, what is your status?  Regulator 665, confirm.<br>  We are receiving negative  Hey, Zareh.<br>  Yes.<br>  You're gonna need more regulators.<br>  - Oh.<br> - Yes.<br>  Who's ready to get the hell out of here?  - Yeah! - Yes!  Hmm.<br>  It doesn't quite taste like the real thing, does it?  I've never eaten a real apple.<br>  Well, how sad.<br>  Apples are a thing of beauty.<br>  You want to talk about oppression,  you should start in your own mess hall.<br>  It's made of our shit, you know.<br>  That's the base material that we use in our replicators.<br>  We deconstruct it to the atomic level  and then reform the atoms.<br>  It's pretty good for shit,  and we don't have to commit atrocities for it.<br>  Well, you're not being very diplomatic.<br>  And you're wasting my time.<br>  Are we negotiating or not?  Fine.<br>  If the Chain is to unite with the Federation,  you need to send the message  that our culture is fundamentally valid and ethical.<br>  And how are we supposed to do that?  By acknowledging that capitalism is already happening  within the Federation.<br>  When was the last time anyone from around here  visited Deep Space 253?  - A while.<br> - 87 years.<br>  - Not by choice.<br> - It's way the hell out there.<br>  But DS253 has been trading  with an Emerald Chain mercantile for nearly a century.<br>  You need to sanction that trade,  and you need to permit the Chain  to establish an embassy on the station.<br>  That will send a very powerful message.<br>  Your mercantile exchanges  they traffic in goods that are used for enslavement.<br>  Some still have open slave markets.<br>  And I have already submitted a charter amendment  to our congress outlawing slavery.<br>  And it has enough support to pass.<br>  I had to spend a lot of political capital,  but it has the support of regular citizens.<br>  In order for me to sell it to the president,  you'd gonna need to step away from the influence  you're exerting on Kwejian  and the other 50 pre-warp planets you've targeted.<br>  You're asking very powerful people  to give up huge amounts of income.<br>  Why don't you explain it to them  by hijacking one of their ships,  kidnapping its crew, and using it  - to break through their shields? - Admiral?  Minister Osyraa.<br>  Thank you.<br>  Some of your regulators decided to go  for a space walk without their EV suits.<br>  Maybe we should move things along.<br>  - What's this? - This is an armistice  with terms that your president can sign off on.<br>  The Emerald Chain will desist from any so-called  "Prime Directive violations" moving forward.<br>  And I commit to a 15-year, systematic walk-back  from Kwejian and any other worlds like it.<br>  Anything less, and you are buying chaos, and you know it.<br>  I'm gonna need a moment to read this.<br>  Be my guest.<br>  I can't block your life signs,  but I can scramble 'em.<br>  The minute you get those doors open, I'll initiate.<br>  Sensors will display every life sign  that's been in this ship in the last three months.<br>  So it'll look like there are thousands of us on board.<br>  Should let you get lost in the noise, move freely  - for a little while.<br> - We'll have to move fast.<br>  - I'll hold 'em off as long as I can.<br> - I'll help.<br>  What? What? No, no, no, you can't.<br> You can't!  Listen, hey, listen.<br> I know that Osyraa  took Discovery on my watch, but I do have a plan.<br>  I'm not staying 'cause I don't trust you.<br>  I'm staying because you're the best chance  for Michael to make it out of here alive.<br>  Someone check on the hostages and Team 8.<br>  They're not responding.<br>  On my mark.<br>  Three, two, one, go.<br>  What the hell?!  Go, go, go, go, go, go.<br>  - Thank you.<br> - Good luck.<br>  Code alpha five.<br>  All regulators, code alpha five.<br>  - Something's wrong.<br> - Well, the regulators are well trained.<br>  They will get it sorted.<br>  She's hijacked the ship.<br> You know this, don't you?  We will return the ship as soon as our work here is done.<br>  She's taken hostages.<br>  I'm a hostage!  Osyraa is negotiating a way  to bring the spore drive to the entire galaxy.<br>  You may not like her methods,  but she's more than you're making her out to be.<br>  Look at me, Mr.<br> Stamets.<br>  I should not be here.<br>  Maybe in your time, when technology was free  and travel was easy, but here in my time,  with a genetic defect?  My parents worked at the exchange.<br>  They asked Osyraa for a meeting.<br>  She did not have to say yes, but she did.<br>  I was ten.<br> I didn't have much time left.<br>  But she saw potential in me.<br>  And now  I am a scientist, I have a family.<br>  And I have been supported  in a life dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge.<br>  She has given me everything.<br>  And not just me.<br>  I've also seen evidence of the science she supports.<br>  A pesticide on Kwejian.<br>  Yes.<br> That-that is a perfect example.<br>  I was the junior scientist when they perfected that.<br>  We have transformed entire planets.<br>  She forced Kwejian to participate in the extinction  of one of their species to get that pesticide.<br>  Well  that must be an overstatement.<br>  She threatened them with famine.<br>  The death of millions.<br> Children.<br>  I  My friend Michael barely escaped one of her labor camps.<br>  I believe you when you say that she's  more than she appears to be.<br>  But she is also  exactly what she appears to be.<br>  - Michael - I only stunned him.<br>  We need to move fast.<br>  - Status report.<br> - At the door.<br>  Nearly through, sir.<br>  - It's not too late for you to go.<br> - And miss all the fun?  Seriously, Ryn.<br>  No.<br> Michael's doing something.<br>  You're doing something.<br> They are  I can't just sit around and hope anymore.<br>  I have to do this.<br>  - I'm going in.<br> - I want them alive.<br>  We got this.<br>  We need backup.<br>  Let's go, Paul.<br> We have to move.<br>  No.<br> I'm not going.<br>  Paul!  We have to jump back now.<br>  He's in the nebula, and so is Saru.<br>  We have to get you off this ship.<br>  They'll die.<br>  I know.<br>  I already lost him once.<br>  I can't go through that again.<br>  And Adira, what would I tell them?  Adira is with them.<br>  No.<br>  - No, no, no, no, no - Hey.<br>  Let go of me.<br>  I can't do that.<br>  - Let me go! - No  Paul!  My whole life is in that nebula!  I know.<br>  Who's he modeled after?  Um no one.<br>  It's, uh, computer-generated.<br>  Hmm.<br> Totally blank canvas, huh?  Nothing that would cause any offense or alarm.<br>  Do you ever think about what it costs you,  all this abstraction?  Lying causes a physiological change in a face.<br>  So why don't you just pick someone  who is known to tell the truth?  Make it real, as opposed to an idea.<br>  This armistice  it's very impressive.<br>  You've made a lot of concessions.<br>  I told you, I came to make a deal.<br>  There's one more thing.<br>  Ask.<br> I'm in a charitable mood.<br>  Who's going to be the face of this?  In official Federation matters,  who is actually going to represent the Chain?  Yeah, I see what you're getting at.<br>  Can't be me, 'cause of my reputation.<br>  Well, I would appoint someone appropriate.<br>  A well-respected scientist, perhaps.<br>  And that person won't just be a proxy for you?  Of course not.<br>  - That is not the truth.<br> - Oh!  He glitched.<br>  Ask me again.<br>  For this armistice to be worth anything,  then the person representing the Chain  has to be proven credible.<br>  And the only way that that can happen  is if he or she functions  completely independently of you.<br>  And tries you for your crimes.<br>  Excuse me?  They're well documented.<br>  You've never stood trial,  because no one's been able to compel the Chain.<br>  You're staring at the past.<br>  I just drew you a real map to the future.<br>  The past is the only light with which we can see the future.<br>  Your willingness to do this will send a message,  and I promise you I will not let anyone forget that.<br>  It's just more abstractions.<br>  The past cannot be undone.<br>  But it could be made right.<br>  We all had to make hard choices because of the Burn.<br>  Spare me your judgment.<br>  Osyraa, I want peace.<br>  I want the Federation to join the Chain,  and I want to learn from your great society.<br>  The Burn has left us with a legacy of  of fear, of isolation  of scarcity that still clouds our moral clarity,  a clarity that I fight for on a daily basis  and I ask my people to die for.<br>  So if that's the reason that we can't reach an accord today,  well I can live with that.<br>  You're making a mistake.<br>  Osyraa, your people are good.<br>  I beg you to be as good as they are.<br>  I can promise you justice.<br>  Oh, I can promise you the same.<br>  You have us.<br> Now what?  Now you get to explain yourselves to Osyraa.<br>  We failed you, Osyraa.<br>  You're a scientist.<br>  You, however  you were brought in to secure the ship.<br>  You lost our hostages  and the key to making the spore drive work.<br>  - Everyone is still on board.<br> - Where are they?  He hacked into the system and messed with the sensors.<br>  Give me five minutes, I'll get him to reverse it.<br>  Airlocks are the only way off this ship.<br>  Seal them all and check them all.<br>  And if you don't have better news for me in ten minutes,  I will shove you out of one of them myself.<br>  Aurellio.<br>  It's probably best for you to leave the bridge now.<br>  I need to get my sensors back online.<br>  Osyraa, there is  no need for violence.<br>  I know this is something that you don't see every day,  but it is how we make progress.<br>  And it is not always pleasant.<br>  Now, it's up to you if you want to stay.<br>  Okay, then.<br>  Ryn.<br>  Fix my sensors.<br>  No.<br>  Now is not the moment for you to develop a spine.<br>  I'm not afraid of you anymore.<br>  I've seen real bravery, real strength and loyalty.<br>  And love.<br>  You're nothing compared to that.<br>  All you have is fear  and no one is feared forever.<br>  Who needs forever?  Wait!  Wait.<br>  I know where you can find dilithium.<br>  More than the entire Chain can use in a hundred lifetimes.<br>  Let me guess.<br>  It's in the Verubin Nebula, and that's where Saru is.<br>  Yeah, but the nebula is massive.<br>  And dangerous.<br>  I know exactly how to get you in and out safely.<br>  Just let Ryn and the crew go.<br>  Please.<br>  - Why - Aurellio.<br>  Truth serum.<br>  Let's make sure Kwejian doesn't lie to me.<br>  - Osyraa, please - Do it!  Tell the Viridian to start firing on exterior shields.<br>  I'd like to get the hell out of here.<br>  What are you  It's an emergency escape field.<br>  I'm turning on the homing beacon.<br>  Fed HQ will see you and bring you in  before Osyraa knows you're missing.<br>  Michael, they're my whole life.<br>  Look at me.<br>  They'll die a terrible, painful death!  Damn it, Michael, look at me!  Osyraa will destroy what is left of the Federation.<br>  And she's gonna use you to do it.<br>  No, no, no, we-we have time.<br>  Right now, you and me, let's go.<br> We have time.<br>  What are you doing?  No.<br>  No.<br> We came to the future for you.<br>  We followed you!  Hugh followed you!  We gave up everything so you wouldn't have to be here alone!  How can you do this?!  I'm sorry.<br>  Michael!  You're gonna be really sorry you did that.<br>  We're clear.<br>  Hurry, more regulators will be coming.<br>  - It's locked.<br> - Okay.<br> Detmer.<br>  Take as many weapons as you can carry.<br>  We don't have much time.<br>  We make it to the bridge no matter what.<br>  That means that if somebody falls, we keep going.<br>  Understood?  Steady.<br>  Steady.<br>  You're the sphere data, aren't you?  Indeed we are.<br>  Hello.<br> Greetings.<br>  - It hid itself in the DOT-23s.<br> - What?  You here to help us?  I'm at your service, Captain.<br>  Shall we take back the ship?      <br>
