                    			[NARRATOR.]<br> Previously on Star Trek: Discovery:  - This is not our universe.<br> - [BURNHAM.]<br> We are in a parallel universe.<br>  One governed by the Terran Empire.<br>  They're ruled by a faceless emperor with absolute authority.<br>  Most places and ships from our universe exist here.<br>  Same goes for people.<br>  We could meet another version of ourselves?  Lieutenant Stamets is nonresponsive.<br>  [CULBER.]<br> No way he can get back into that cube.<br>  He's contained for his own safety.<br>  His adrenals are spiking uncontrollably.<br>    [TYLER.]<br> Closing in on the cockpit.<br>  [SCREAMING.]<br>  It happened again, flashes of memory.<br> Worse this time.<br>  It appears the Klingons have transformed you.<br>  - Into what? - You're not you.<br>  [NECK CRACKS.]<br>  We're not the first ship from our universe to find ourselves here.<br>  U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Defiant.<br>  We find out how it did make it over, could be our way home.<br>  Captain Burnham will be returning to the Shenzhou with me as bounty.<br>  [TYLER.]<br> Whatever you do  [GRUNTING AND SHOUTING.]<br>  whatever this place makes you do  whatever happens to you, or me  however we change, I am here to protect you.<br>  [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING.]<br>  Harrington to engineering,  I'm still working on that electrical malfunction on deck 12.<br>  [MAN ON COMM.]<br> Acknowledged.<br>  Deck 11, section 6 is reporting the same problem.<br>  - Think I've got that bulkhead operational.<br> - Understood.<br>  Make sure manual controls are routed  to emergency operational systems.<br>  - [STAMETS.]<br> The forest.<br> - Hold on a minute.<br>  [STAMETS.]<br> The forest.<br>  The forest.<br>  The forest.<br>  The forest is dark, but I can see him through the trees.<br>  The trees.<br>  The trees.<br>  The trees.<br>  [BURNHAM.]<br> I can't rest here.<br> Not really.<br>  My eyes open  and it's like waking from the worst nightmare I could imagine.<br>  Even the light  is different.<br>  The cosmos has lost its brilliance.<br>  And everywhere I turn  there's fear.<br>  [DOOR OPENS.]<br>  Captain.<br>  I have come to perform your daily ablutions.<br>  What is your name?  A A slave has no name.<br>  [BURNHAM.]<br> It's been two days.<br>  But they're already inside my head.<br>  Every moment is a test.<br>  Can you bury your heart?  Can you hide your decency?  Can you continue to pretend to be one of them?  Even as, little by little, it kills the person you really are?  [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER COMM.]<br>  You're all guilty of malicious thoughts against your emperor.<br>  By order of the sovereign Terran Empire,  I hereby sentence you to death.<br>  [MAN.]<br> Energizing.<br>  [BURNHAM.]<br> I've continued to study their ways, read all that I can.<br>  It's getting easier to pass.<br>  Which is exactly what I feared the most.<br>  [TYLER.]<br> You can never be one of them.<br>  We're all human here.<br>  We all start out with the same drives, the same needs.<br>  Maybe none of us, no matter what world we're from, really know  what darkness is waiting inside.<br>  Thank you  for this.<br>  You remind me of everything good.<br>  Of what I want my world to look like.<br>  My first year at the academy,  I was terrified of open space.<br>  I could fly anything, no sweat, but I dreaded putting on that suit.<br>  Until I remembered the tether.<br>  They're mandatory the first few times a cadet goes out in an EV and  they link you back to what you know, what you love  help you stay strong, even as you head out into that  terrifying abyss.<br>  And that's you.<br>  You're my tether.<br>  You bring me back.<br>  You did it before we were stranded, and you're still doing it now.<br>  [DOOR OPENS.]<br>  We're done here.<br>  Go check on my prisoner.<br>  [DOOR OPENS.]<br>  [DOOR CLOSES.]<br>  This looks good, Saru.<br>  I'm gonna call you Saru, in honor of a respected friend.<br>  Yes, Captain.<br>  [COMPUTER.]<br> Incoming transmission from the I.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Discovery.<br>  Captain Tilly, Sylvia.<br>  [SIGHS.]<br>  Computer, accept transmission.<br>  - Is this a secure channel? - Low band, zero traffic.<br>  I'm alone, Tilly.<br>  I have Mr.<br> Saru.<br>  Hang in there, friend.<br>  [SARU.]<br> Is your status unchanged?  Yes, sir.<br>  I've accessed the classified files,  but the data's too massive to decipher from here.<br>  The Terran firewall is impenetrable.<br>  I'm unable to transmit intel off-ship without being detected.<br>  An oppressive regime is, by nature, a fearful regime.<br>  I'm afraid you must devise a workaround.<br>  The data concerning the U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Defiant's entry into this realm  is our last best hope at forming our own plan of escape.<br>  So I take it Lieutenant Stamets' condition hasn't improved?  I'm afraid not.<br>  I will find a way.<br>  Oh, uh, one last question, immaterial to the mission.<br>  My kind are few in our universe.<br>  I had hoped  Have you encountered any Kelpiens onboard?  No, I haven't, Saru.<br>  - I'm sorry.<br> - Oh, not at all.<br>  It was merely a personal curiosity.<br>  Stay safe, Michael.<br>  And be wary.<br>  Culber was her friend and colleague.<br>  She deserves to know the truth.<br>  The news that we are dealing with an intra-vessel homicide  would distract Burnham from her vital mission.<br>  The circumstances surrounding Dr.<br> Culber's death are  difficult to process.<br>  Even for me.<br>  I hate seeing him like this.<br>  If Stamets killed Culber, he may be a danger to all of us.<br>  He only escaped because the containment field was disabled.<br>  Culber probably lowered it.<br>  Who could stand to see the person they love in a cage?  - Perhaps that was his fatal error.<br> - Stamets didn't kill anyone.<br>  Are you suggesting there's a murderer running free on our ship?  No, I'm saying that this  This is not Paul Stamets.<br>  [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER COMM.]<br>  I've analyzed scans of his neurological function.<br>  Hyperactivity of white matter in his brain  has increased at an alarming rate.<br>  Redirected blood flow almost exclusively to the frontopolar cortex.<br>  Rendering all other segments of the brain essentially nonfunctional.<br>  This wasn't a murder.<br> This was an unfortunate consequence  of an addled mind trying to reach beyond a cloud of confusion.<br>  We are losing him, Commander, and fast.<br>  The lieutenant's health is in the hands of our medical officers.<br>  Medicine isn't working.<br> This is a spore issue.<br>  Which means no one is more qualified to treat him than I am.<br>  Please?
