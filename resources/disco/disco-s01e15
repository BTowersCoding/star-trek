                    			1 [SPEAKING KLINGON.]<br>  Yesterday we dined on the entrails  of his brethren.<br>  And today you seek his favor?  Transport our visitor to guest quarters on deck three.<br>  - SARU: Tyler? - Is she alive?  SARU: Specialist Burnham has returned safely.<br>  [SPEAKS KLINGON.]<br>  - Can I? - Focus on your recovery.<br>  When I look at you now, I see Voqâs eyes.<br>  I see him.<br>  There is irony here, of course.<br>  The man you fell in love with was a Klingon.<br>  Do not regret loving someone, Michael.<br>  I need you to tell me.<br>  How did you defeat the Klingon Empire?  The Klingons are like cancer cells:  to root them out,  you must destroy the tumor at its source.<br>  A Klingon attack is imminent.<br>  They are gathering forces  to launch a strike on this whole system.<br>  We need to take it to them.<br>  At 2100 hours, the USS Discovery will jump  to the Klingon homeworld.<br>  Allow me to introduce you  to the person who will chart  your course to QoânoS.<br>  Captain Philippa Georgiou.<br>  [INDISTINCT COMMS CHATTER.]<br>  [SPEAKS KLINGON.]<br>  [COMMS CHATTER CONTINUES IN KLINGON.]<br>  [INDISTINCT COMMS CHATTER  BURNHAM: On the eve of battle, on a cold and windless night,  an old general turned to a young soldier.<br>  "Tomorrow," said the master, "you will know fear.<br>"  The young soldier, who had not yet experienced  the agony of war,  looked at the general with quizzical eyes.<br>  "How will I know fear if I do not know what it looks like?"  The general replied, "You will know fear"  because it speaks very fast  "and it speaks very loud.<br>"  Status.<br> Helm?  Bearing 94 mark 21, 12 light-years  - from Klingon homeworld - Do not show respect  by referring to that green dot  as "homeworld.<br>"  Klingons are animals, and they donât have homes.<br>  Call it QoânoS,  or "the enemy planet.<br>" Ops?  Shields holding at 100%.<br>  - Our scans show - I have little interest  in what weâre scanning.<br>  I care whatâs scanning us.<br>  Communications?  Discovery is running dark, Captain.<br>  My favorite way to run.<br>  BURNHAM: If that is how fear acts, recognizing it is easy.<br>  But as the young soldier considered  the generalâs advice, she asked the question facing us now:  "Once I know fear, how do I defeat it?"  Specialist,  uh, I would appreciate  your help with a glitch  in the optical-data network.<br>  She does not embody Federation ideals,  and weâre supposed to follow her orders?  The Federation put her here.<br>  Burnham.<br> I did not give you permission  to leave your station.<br>  Whatâs wrong?  Are you scared, Number One?  Where Iâm from, thereâs a saying:  "Scared Kelpien makes for tough Kelpien.<br>"  Have you gotten tough since we served together  on the Shenzhou, Mr.<br> Saru?  Affirmative, Captain.<br>  Very tough.<br>  So much so that many find me simply unpalatable.<br>  Hmm.<br> I donât know about that.<br>  Where are you from, Captain?  That saying, about Kelpiens,  is so apt,  having experienced it firsthand.<br>  I wonder where it originated.<br>  Donât be silly, Michael.<br>  You know I grew up in Malaysia.<br>  But where, exactly?  I went there with you once, but I canât remember the name.<br>  Pulau Langkawi.<br>  Right.<br>  Those beautiful beaches.<br>  Indeed.<br>  Letâs take a walk.<br>  [DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN.]<br>  GEORGIOU: Try to expose me again  and Iâll lock you in the brig.<br>  If Starfleet recruited a Terran  to lead the mission, they are desperate.<br>  The Federation had a problem.<br>  I offered them a solution in exchange for my freedom.<br>  And whatâs so bad  about desperation?  You were desperate when you begged me to reveal  how my empire beat the Klingons.<br>  You instigate  valiantly, then second-guess.<br>  Iâve now read about your actions on the eve of the war.<br>  You know your problem?  No follow-through.<br>  You should have killed my counterpart in her ready room,  attacked the Klingons, and then been a hero.<br>  Tell me the real plan.<br>  Never do that again.<br>  Your Federation is losing.<br>  The Klingon armada is already headed toward your homeworld.<br>  My knowledge is giving you a fighting chance.<br>  Are you with me or against me?  [DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN.]<br>  With you.<br>  Captain.<br>        [ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS.]<br>   You?  How?  Our Lord pierced your heart.<br>  House TâKuvma feasted on your flesh.<br>  You have the wrong Philippa Georgiou.<br>  Either way, I can tell you require seasoning.<br>  My home.<br>  There are seven chimneys on QoânoS  which lead into a dormant volcano system.<br>  Of these, which is the best  for a landing party to reach on foot?  I will tell you nothing.<br>  This war ends when we crush you.<br>  United under TâKuvmaâs call.<br>  This war may rage on, but your war  Your great dream of Klingon unification  Itâs already lost.<br>    You both talk too much.<br>  [GRUNTS.]<br>  - Computer.<br> - No!  Reactivate containment field.<br>  Control to my voice.<br>  Tell me where my party should land.<br>  [HISSES.]<br>  [YELLS.]<br>  [COUGHS.]<br>  Where?  [LâRELL ROARS.]<br>  [GASPING.]<br>  [COUGHING.]<br>  [LAUGHING.]<br>  You have already lost.<br>  - Enough! - [COUGHING.]<br>  [SIGHS.]<br>  Thereâs another way.<br>  GEORGIOU: Admiral Cornwell  briefed me on this half-breed.<br>  I can see, from a strategic standpoint,  its value as a weapon.<br>  But as itâs Klingon, it has been neutered.<br>  It is benign.<br>  Useless to them,  yet tarnished to the Federation,  so what good is it to either side?  He has access to the Klingonâs memories.<br>  All I can see is a who-knows-what  playing with a string.<br>  This is a bowline, it doesnât run.<br>  It doesnât slip.<br>  Itâs the first thing I learned as a kid that made me me.<br>  It ties me to my past.<br> Who I am.<br>  Voqâs life, his memories Theyâre here, too.<br>  Always with me.<br>  Iâm willing to share his knowledge.<br>  Not for you.<br>  But for  Starfleet.<br>  Do you want my help or not?  What do you know about the surface of QoânoS?  The plan is to use a drone  with rock-penetrating surveillance systems  to map the surface and identify military targets,  in preparation for a future full-scale attack.<br>  Unfortunately, the cave Discovery will hide in  isnât connected to the planetâs dormant volcanoes.<br>  In order for the mapping drone to work,  it has to be introduced into one of these.<br>  As youâre aware, information regarding QoânoS  is virtually non-existent.<br>  Weâre depending on black market surveys  acquired by the Vulcans over a century ago.<br>  This chimneyâs in the High Council chamber of the First City.<br>  All high-bred arrogance, that place.<br>  This oneâs now flooded by the River Skral.<br>  Here.<br> This is your best bet.<br>  The safest access point for the drone.<br>  Centuries ago, when the caldera was active,  these vents were shrines.<br>  Live sacrifices were thrown in to honor Molor.<br>  When Kahless defeated Molor,  those temples were abandoned, built over.<br>  Uh, the ones that remained were shielded  to make them impossible to find with sensors.<br>  Youâll have to transport down there  and do the legwork yourself.<br>  Whatâs there now?  The land was given to the Orions,  who built an embassy outpost over the ruins.<br>  In my world, the Orions are delinquents, pirates,  - slave traders.<br> - Itâs not much different in ours.<br>  Excellent.<br>  He will accompany us and help us sniff out  what weâre after.<br>  Will that be a problem?  - No.<br> - No.<br>  Captain.<br>  I looked over the crew manifest.<br>  Thereâs somebody else I want with us.<br>  Enter.<br>  I am so pleased to see you, Tilly.<br>  Thank you.<br> I have heard And read so much about you.<br>  Michael can attest, Iâm always asking about Captain Georgiou.<br>  Seeing your face reminds me  of the great fun the two of us had.<br>  Subjugating the Betazoids.<br>  Wiping out Mintaka III.<br>  - Oh, sheâs not - No.<br>  So sheâs from  Mm.<br>  Youâre the Terran emperor.<br>  Donât do that.<br>  You look so much like her.<br>  Younger, maybe.<br>  But all that killing ages a person.<br>  These are hideous, of course.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br>: I know.<br> What is happening?  She requested you, for the landing party.<br>  Oh.<br>  But just so y-youâre clear,  I-I am not the same person I was in your universe.<br>  Donât be so sure, Killy.<br>  You will have the honor of carrying the mapping drone.<br>  Go to quarters.<br>  Dress as lowlifes.<br>  We need items to trade so as to seem legitimate.<br>  Gabriel must have found something interesting  lying around in this universe.<br>  You gonna be okay down there?  You donât need to worry about me.<br>  Ready, Lieutenant Stamets?  STAMETS: First, an alternate universe,  now a Klingon cave  on a hundred-year-old map.<br>  Ready as can be, Mr.<br> Saru.<br>  Black alert.<br>  - To QoânoS, please.<br> - Aye, Captain.<br>  COMPUTER: Black alert.<br> Black alert.<br>  Shields holding.<br>  Stabilizer beams are compensating  for the planetâs gravitational pull.<br>  Am I good or what?  We are aboard and steady.<br>  You are clear to transport.<br>  Energize.<br>    [INDISTINCT CHATTER.]<br>  TILLY: Not a lot of humans around here.<br>  Except the dregs from our race.<br>  TYLER: Exactly.<br>  The Orions here arenât likely to trust us  or give up any information.<br>  [INDISTINCT CHATTER.]<br>  Keep walking, Federation.<br> No one wants you here.<br>  Tilly.<br>  Insult her again, and your nose is gonna be able  to sniff the back of your head.<br>  Weâre here to make a deal.<br>  GEORGIOU: Show her the stash.<br>  Tell her what sheâs looking at.<br>  Nausicaan disruptor pistols.<br>  Latest spec.<br>  Paralithium cell with beam and a pulse firing mode.<br>  Polyalloy casings, making it all but invisible  to security screeners.<br>  2,000 darseks.<br>  Letâs see what else you got.<br>  All this arms dealing  has my appetite up.<br>  Anyone else hungry?  Anyone? Michael?  - Greetings.<br> - Two, please.<br>  - What is that? - I have no idea.<br>  Iâm not actually hungry I wanted to talk to you.<br>  I intuited.<br>  Do you have any idea what she might be up to?  No.<br>  All we can do is watch her like a hawk,  and make sure she stays on mission.<br>  Iâve, um  I realize how hard this must be for you.<br>  But I got your back.<br>  Thank you.<br>  What is that?  - Delicious.<br> - Itâs a space whale.<br>  Gormagander?  Enough distractions.<br>  Weâre not here for bread and circuses.<br>      On second thought,  the circus is where weâll start.<br>  [SPITS.]<br>  [SYNCOPATED PERCUSSION PLAYS.]<br>  [INDISTINCT CHATTER.]<br>  - So, what should we, um - Shh!  GEORGIOU: I knew your whole universe  couldnât be boring.<br>  [CLICKS TONGUE.]<br>  Use this.<br>  Weâll be more effective if we split up, buy information.<br>  Whatever gets us to that shrine.<br>  Hmm.<br>  How much for a little me time?  Over there.<br>  Bring your friend.<br>  No, no, that, uh, t very generous.<br>  I think Iâll Iâm just gonna stay out here.<br>  Sheâs not for you.<br>  Guard the drone.<br>  [KLINGONS LAUGH, GROWL.]<br>  TYLER: Maybe these guys can lead us to the shrine.<br>  BURNHAM: If theyâll talk to us.<br>  TYLER: The game is called tâSang.<br>  Translates to "obliterate them.<br>"  - You know how to play? - I think I do.<br>  And I think Iâm good at it.<br>  I mean, Voq was good at it.<br>  He was a decent gambler  He felt the numbers always fell his way,  as if the universe was making up  for his bad luck with everything else.<br>  Like what?  He was born with a rare mutation  that made his skin translucent white.<br>  The others considered him a freak of nature.<br>                  [FEMALE SPEAKS KLINGON.]<br>            - [KLINGONS LAUGHING.]<br> - [TYLER SHOUTS.]<br>      [SHOUTS.]<br>  Join me?  Oh, thank you.<br>  Smoke?  Oh, that, uh, thatâs so sweet.<br> No, thank you.<br>  I have, um, I have a very narrow esophagus.<br>  Itâs, uh, strange but true, so thatâs bad for that  - Iâm not-Iâm not trying to be rude - Get her out.<br>  You know what? I-I would love some.<br>  Just a little bit.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  Inhale.<br>  Mmm.<br>  Do you think, um  [SLURRING.]<br>: do you think I got  [GIGGLES.]<br>  I got nothing.<br>  None of them know about an ancient shrine.<br>  You won everyone over quickly.<br>  A human speaking Klingon is amusing to them.<br>  Might as well be a dog on waterskis.<br>  Is that an old Klingon saying?  No, I I just made it up.<br>  I I like to waterski.<br>  Yeah, you have a boat.<br> I remember.<br>  You raced out of there pretty quick.<br>  You all right?  I never told you about my parents.<br>  What happened to them.<br>  No.<br>  I mean, I Iâve heard things.<br>  I never wanted to push.<br>  They were stationed at a human-Vulcan science outpost  at Doctari Alpha.<br>  [SIGHS.]<br>  My mom and dad had planned a family vacation to Mars.<br>  But  I begged them to stay  for three more days  so I could witness a nearby star go supernova.<br>  Then the Klingons attacked.<br>  My dad tried to barricade  the kitchen door  while my mom hid me in a cabinet.<br>  And I couldnât see, but I could hear everything.<br>  They killed my dad first.<br>  That was quick.<br>  They took longer with my mom.<br>  And when it was over,  they sat down.<br>  At our table.<br>  Ate dinner.<br> Our dinner.<br>  And they were talking and laughing.<br>  And just now, all that laughter  How could you not hate them?  And me, for what Iâve become?  It would be so much simpler if I could.<br>  I look around here and I just  I see people living their lives.<br>  Maybe itâs not normal to us,  but in their own way, ordinary.<br>  The emperor was wrong.<br> This is a home.<br>  And if we give the Federation targets to attack,  it wonât ever be the same.<br>  I can see both sides.<br>  Literally.<br>  The side Iâve chosen is where you stand,  where itâs possible to feel compassion  and sympathy for your enemy.<br>  But I can guarantee no-no Klingon  ever felt that way toward you.<br>  You did.<br>  [INDISTINCT CHATTER.]<br>  You see that?  Pouring an extra drink.<br>  Setting it on fire.<br>  Thatâs a step specific to the followers of Molor.<br>  Thereâs a decent chance they know about that shrine.<br>  [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION.]<br>  Mm.<br>  Did you enjoy yourself?  Did you?  I learned so many new things.<br>  We shouldnât charge you.<br>  But we have to charge you.<br>  Perhaps if you teach me something new,  it will be fair trade.<br>  [PANTING.]<br>  Where is the shrine of Molor?  Hey, stop!  Hey, stop.<br> Shame on you.<br>  You were asleep.<br>  Iâm Orion.<br>  What did, uh, we inhale, it  my mouth tastes like  sulfur and-and ash.<br>  Volcanic vapor, straight from the source.<br>  Yeah, but not really, right?  âCause all the volcanoes here are extinct.<br>  Oh, no.<br>  Theyâre alive.<br>  Then howâs the drone gonna get down there?  The heat will destroy it.<br>  Give me that.<br>  [GASPS.]<br>  Oh, shit, that is not a drone.<br>  Tilly to Burnham.<br>  Go ahead, Tilly.<br>  First of all, um, so, Iâm very high,  uh, but you need to listen to me.<br>  There are active volcanoes right beneath us right now  and the drone, also, thatâs not a drone.<br>  Itâs a, itâs a like a hydro bomb.<br>  We keep them on the Discovery  - so we can reco - What did you say  about a hydro bomb?  Tilly?  Cadet, respond.<br>  I know where to find the shrine.<br>  Whatâs wrong?  Itâs Tilly.<br>  A hydro bomb? What kind of damage can it do?  Detonate it into an active volcanic system, itâs just  - apocalyptic.<br> - A phreatic eruption:  water flashes into steam and triggers a massive explosion.<br>  Landmasses directly over  the reaction center will be vaporized.<br>  - Oh - Ash will fill the atmosphere.<br>  Within weeks, QoânoS will be uninhabitable.<br>  This was the plan all along.<br>  - Burnham to Discovery.<br> - Go ahead, Burnham.<br>  Georgiou is about to instigate a catastrophic  natural disaster on QoânoS.<br>  She may already be in the shrine.<br>  - Can you get a transporter lock on her? - SARU: Affirmative.<br>  However, beaming her out is not an option.<br>  The shrineâs shields make it unsafe for biological transport.<br>  What about the bomb? Can you get the bomb?  SARU: We are too late.<br>  The signal is fading.<br>  We must contact Starfleet.<br>  Saru, I think sheâs following Starfleetâs orders.<br>  I need to talk to Admiral Cornwell.<br>  Is this how Starfleet wins the war?  Genocide?  You want to do this here? Fine.<br>  Terms of atrocity  are convenient after the fact.<br>  The Klingons are on the verge of wiping out the Federation.<br>  Yes.<br>  But ask yourself:  why did you put this mission  in the hands of a Terran and why the secrecy?  Itâs because you know itâs not who we are.<br>  It very soon will be.<br>  We do not have the luxury of principles.<br>  That is all we have, Admiral.<br>  A year ago  I stood alone.<br>  I believed that our survival  was more important than our principles.<br>  I was wrong.<br>  Do we need a mutiny today  to prove who we are?  We are Starfleet.<br>  What is it youâre suggesting?  BURNHAM: Change of plans.<br>  Really?  [SCOFFS.]<br> Says who?  Deactivate the detonator, Philippa.<br>  Your freedom is still granted, hereâs the proof.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br>  You talked them out of it, didnât you?  Of planetary slaughter? Yes.<br>  Oh, donât be so dramatic.<br>  When I did this in my universe,  it didnât wipe out the Klingons.<br>  A decent number should be able to save themselves.<br>  Plus, theyâll have an advantage.<br>  No Terran ships firing on them as they try to escape.<br>  - Turn it off.<br> - Has it ever occurred to you  that I was doing this for you?  By ending the war,  Iâd set you free  from the guilt and pain you carry because of it.<br>  Not buying it.<br>  [SCOFFS.]<br> Worth a try.<br>  You really are nothing like my Georgiou, are you?  No.<br> And I never have been.<br>  Sheâs dead, Michael.<br>  There are no second chances.<br>  No, I suppose not.<br>  I do like you.<br>  Why not join me?  The bomb is in position.<br>  We have the detonator.<br>  Starfleet and Klingon alike will be at our mercy.<br>  I had much the same thought.<br>  Give it to me.<br>  [WEAPON POWERS UP.]<br>  Take your freedom  in exchange for the detonator.<br>  Or try to escape my ship and its crew  and be hunted by the Federation for the rest of your days.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br> You think your Federation scares me?  Not particularly.<br>  But the only way youâre gonna get past me is to kill me.<br>  So youâll have to watch me die again.<br>  And did I mention being hunted for the rest of your days?  - Ugh.<br> - [WEAPON POWERS DOWN.]<br>  The detonator is coded to my bioprint.<br>  Would you like it recoded to yours?  Not to mine, no.<br>  All clear.<br>  What is this?  This is the place the Federation crushed the Klingons.<br>  We planted a bomb  in the heart of your homeworld.<br>  QoânoS will be destroyed.<br>  You bring me here to gloat?  No.<br>  To offer you an alternative.<br>  Klingons respond to strength.<br>  Use the fate of QoânoS to bend them to your will.<br>  Preserve your civilization  rather than watch it be destroyed.<br>  But I am no one.<br>  TYLER: You once told Voq  that you didnât want the mantle of leadership.<br>        Itâs time for you to leave the shadows.<br>  Iâll leave you to it, then.<br>  Be good, Philippa.<br>  Or youâll come for me?  Make sure I donât have to.<br>  [SNORING.]<br>  Isik for your thoughts.<br>  I always wanted to find out what one was.<br>  I never did.<br>  LâRell has arranged for a transport to a MÃ³kai ship.<br>  Theyâre in for a surprise.<br>  Itâs not the human way to make a message heard,  but itâs the Klingon way.<br>  Iâm going with her.<br>  Itâs true, what the emperor said.<br>  Iâm no good for either side.<br> I  But maybe I can be good for both.<br>  Iâve never been great at good-byes.<br>  Neither am I.<br>  Iâve had too many of them.<br>  Michael.<br>  In spite of everything that happened to you,  your capacity to love  literally saved my life.<br>  Iâm gonna miss looking at you.<br>  I see you, Ash.<br>  In your eyes.<br>  Only you.<br>    Thank-thank you.<br>  [CRYING.]<br>  Burnham to Discovery.<br>  One to transport.<br>  [LAUGHTER.]<br>                          BURNHAM: Earth, Andor,  Tellar, Vulcan.<br>  Every planet of the Federation  has made the odyssey out of darkness into light.<br>  So too have the Klingons.<br>  The war is over.<br>  There were triumphs.<br>  Victories of spirit.<br>  Courage beyond reason.<br>  But make no mistake.<br>  These were bleak times.<br>  Times we cannot repeat.<br>  Times we cannot forget.<br>  Isik for your thoughts.<br>  Whatâs an isik, anyway?  Oh, I donât know.<br>  Itâs something my mother  used to say to me.<br>  Thank you for coming.<br>  Iâm glad to see you.<br>  Is everything okay?  When I was growing up, you told me  not to forget my humanity.<br>  I didnât know what that meant.<br>  I didnât how to do it,  I didnât know why I would even want to.<br>  I get it now.<br>  So thank you.<br>  For not giving up on me.<br>  Thatâs what mothers do.<br>  Michael.<br>  Father.<br>  SAREK: What the Federation chose to do  on QoânoS was unprincipled,  and I had a part in it.<br>  The Klingons made it clear they would fight us to extinction.<br>  You were desperate to save us.<br>  I know the feeling all too well.<br>  And yet,  you were able to find another way.<br>  I am not alone  in finding your commitment to Starfleetâs ideals commendable.<br>  I asked if I may give it to you.<br>  Your record has been expunged,  your pardon by the president of the Federation  is official.<br>  Commander Burnham.<br>  The Federation is as grateful to you  as I am to my daughter.<br>  Your mother will stay in Paris for a few days.<br>  I will travel with Discovery to Vulcan.<br>  You are picking up your new captain there.<br>  Iâm glad weâll be making that journey together.<br>  We are no longer on the eve of battle.<br>  Even so, I come to ask myself the same question  that young soldier asked the general  all those years ago: "How do I defeat fear?"  The generalâs answer:  the only way to defeat fear is to tell it "no.<br>"  No.<br> We will not take shortcuts  on the path to righteousness.<br>  No.<br> We will not break the rules  that protect us from our basest instincts.<br>  No.<br> We will not allow  desperation to destroy  moral authority.<br>  I am guilty of all these things.<br>  Some say that in life,  there are no second chances.<br>  Experience tells me that this is true.<br>  But we can only look forward.<br>  We have to be torchbearers,  casting the light so we may see our path  to lasting peace.<br>  We will continue exploring,  discovering new worlds, new civilizations.<br>  Yes.<br>  That is the United Federation of Planets.<br>  CORNWELL: Today, we honor  Ensign Sylvia Tilly.<br>  Accepted into Starfleet Command Training Program.<br>  Yes.<br> That is Starfleet.<br>  CORNWELL: Lieutenant Commander Paul Stamets.<br>  Medical Officer Hugh Culber.<br>  Yes.<br>  That is who we are.<br>  CORNWELL: Commander Saru.<br>  First Kelpien to receive the Medal of Honor.<br>  And who we will always be.<br>  [CHEERING.]<br>  MALE: Bravo!  [CHEERING CONTINUES.]<br>  TILLY: Never been to Vulcan before.<br>  BURNHAM: Well, if thereâs time, Iâll show you around.<br>  Itâs strange that weâre not jumping to Vulcan.<br>  Well, Starfleet has committed to finding a non-human interface.<br>  Until that happens  Iâm happy to go the old-fashioned way.<br>  Captain on the bridge.<br>  Acting captain.<br>  Please take your stations.<br> You may consult  with Science Officer Burnham later.<br>  Thank you, Mr.<br> Saru, for permitting me  this small indulgence.<br>  I never tire of seeing home.<br>  Of course.<br>  Lieutenant Detmer,  have we cleared the Sol system?  - Yes, Captain.<br> - Set course for Vulcan,  and engage at maximum warp.<br>  Aye, sir.<br>  MALE: Realign communications array  [MALE CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY.]<br>  Incoming transmission.<br>  From whom?  Iâm having trouble identifying it.<br>  But itâs a priority-one distress call.<br>  Identify the source, please.<br>  Iâm getting a Federation ID code.<br>  I-Itâs choppy.<br>  Trying to clean it up, sir.<br>  Helm, slow us down.<br>  Dropping us out of warp now, sir.<br>  This is Captain Saru  of the Federation Starship Discovery.<br>  Please identify yourselves.<br>  [ELECTRONIC STATIC, DISTORTED SPEAKING.]<br>  Hailâs from Captain Pike, sir.<br>  Itâs the USS Enterprise.<br>  [ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS.]<br>      <br>
