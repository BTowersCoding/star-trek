                    			1 Previously, on Star Trek: Discovery  LORCA: We are creating a new way to fly.<br>  If the Discovery can be anywhere,  and be gone within an instant,  that's how you beat the Klingons.<br>  The only other  female Michael I ever heard of,  was the mutineer.<br>  You're not her, are you?  I would like to extend an official invitation  to you to join the Discovery.<br>  PSYCHO: 8,000 are dead because of you.<br>  8,186.<br>  LORCA: Klingons won't stop until they've destroyed everything  in their path.<br>  And we can't stop them without you.<br>  Who is she to you?  TYLER: Her name is L'Rell.<br> She was my torturer.<br>  If none of that had happened, I wouldn't be here.<br>  What did you do to me?  I will never let them hurt you.<br>  STAMETS: I'll do one more jump.<br>  Only one more jump.<br>  [SCREAMS.]<br>  TILLY: Computer is reading it as an incomplete navigation sequence.<br>  [GASPING.]<br>  SARU: Captain, I'm afraid I don't know where we are.<br>  Yellow alert.<br>  COMPUTER: Yellow alert.<br>  This isn't Starbase 46.<br>  Where the hell are we?  SARU: Our-our sensors are  uh, recalibrating, sir.<br>  What happened, here?  I don't remember reports of battles  anywhere near Organia.<br>  Blast scoring and damage patterns  are consistent with Federation weapons,  but the hull signatures are a little off.<br>  Off?  Wreckage is Klingon,  but hull density analysis is registering  outside acceptable margins.<br>  Is anything here a threat?  No life signs or active power signatures.<br>  Small favors.<br>  Captain, our navigational array is malfunctioning.<br>  According to these readings,  we jumped to our intended coordinates,  and our position,  relative to the galactic center, is confirmed.<br>  But almost nothing else is where it's supposed to be.<br>  [CRACKLING.]<br>  Nice of you to join us, Mr.<br> Tyler.<br>  I know it was only a yellow alert.<br>  - I'm sorry, sir.<br> - OWOSEKUN: Captain.<br>  A vessel is approaching at sub light speed.<br>  Seems like a Vulcan cruiser.<br>  LORCA: On screen.<br>  Well, the Vulcans must be the ones  who destroyed those Klingons.<br>  - Should we hail them, sir? - Yes, open a channel.<br>  BRYCE: Unidentified Vulcan cruiser,  this is the USS Discovery.<br> Please respond.<br>  TYLER: Captain.<br> The Vulcans are powering up weapons.<br>  They must have registered an active Klingon ship  - somewhere nearby.<br> - Red alert.<br> Shields up.<br>  - [SIRENS BLARE.]<br> - MALE [OVER P.<br>A.<br>.]<br>: All stations at red alert.<br>  Detmer, evasive pattern beta four pi.<br>  - They're doubling back.<br> - I'm not able to lock on, sir.<br>  Do it manually, shoot in a general direction.<br>  Where did that assist come from?  Incoming transmission from the Coope sir.<br>  - Audio only.<br> - Cooper?  Isn't she supposed to be undergoing a refit?  Send it through.<br>  MALE [ON COMM.]<br>: Spooked by rebels, Discovery?  You're losing your edge.<br> Don't worry.<br>  We'll take care of them.<br> Cooper out.<br>  BURNHAM: Vulcan rebels?  Firing on Starfleet?  Engineering, what's the status of the spore drive?  Lieutenant Stamets is non-responsive.<br>  He's stabilized, but there's no way  he can get back into that reaction cube.<br>  TILLY [ON COMM.]<br>: Spore drive is offline, Captain.<br>  SARU: I may have something.<br>  The quantum signature of the Cooper,  as well as that of the Vulcan cruiser,  are inconsistent with ours.<br>  BURNHAM: That's not possible.<br>  All matter native to our universe  resonates with the same quantum signature,  nothing can change it.<br>  That's true.<br>  Unless  this is not our universe.<br>         [ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS.]<br>  Obviously, the idea of parallel worlds  has been around since the 20th century.<br>  And you and Stamets believed  the spore drive could jump between them?  Well, it was a theory I was working on.<br>  Stamets was keen to chase it with me after the war.<br>  But, these areas don't correlate  to anything in the known universe.<br>  We suspected the mycelial network  extended way beyond anything we'd imagined.<br>  A vast system underpinning all quantum realities.<br>  But the exact coordinates of some of the more  esoteric destinations eluded us.<br>  Apparently, the 133 jumps we made filled in the gaps.<br>  An extraordinarily fortunate coincidence.<br>  I'd say unfortunate.<br>  Wouldn't you, Number One?  It's worse than that.<br>  The Klingon cloak-breaking algorithm we'd been refining  there's no way we can send that back to Starfleet now.<br>  That's why we have to make it back.<br>  Otherwise, the ships are just sitting ducks,  the war's as good as lost.<br>  Well, Stamets brought us here accidentally.<br>  So, we should examine the spore drive's navigational logs  - more closely.<br> There could be an indication - I just pushed Stamets too hard.<br>  The number of jumps scrambled his ability  to hold the coordinates for Starbase 46 in his head.<br>  Now, what we need to do is understand where we are  and how to survive.<br>  Then we'll find a way home.<br>  Recalibrate the sensors, and you start looking at the records,  - see if there's something we can learn.<br> - Yes, Captain.<br>  It's a palace.<br> Stay close.<br>  Lieutenant Stamets, please don't hate me,  but what is the spore germination rate, again?

Of course he does.<br>  All right, let the xenoanthropologist get to work.<br>  BURNHAM: I'm downloading the Klingon raider's logs  Images, battle plans, intelligence  that we found from the core.<br>  And, so far, we can conclude  that we are indeed in a parallel universe.<br>  But one not governed by the Federation,  but by a fascistic, human-only organization  known as the Terran Empire.<br>  Most places and ships that are found in our universe,  like the Cooper, exist here.<br>  - The same goes for people.<br> - You mean, we could  literally meet another version of ourselves?  BURNHAM: Theoretically, yes.<br>  Wow.<br>  The Terrans appear to be  the antithesis of us, in every way.<br>  They're an oppressive,  racist, xenophobic culture  that dominates all known space.<br>  And they're ruled by a faceless emperor.<br>  And those ships we found?  They're part of a rebellion  that is made up, essentially,  of all non-human species.<br>  They're fighting for freedom.<br>  The rebellion fears and mistrusts humans.<br>  The Terran culture appears to be predicated upon  an unconditional hatred and rejection  of anything and everything "other.<br>"  That means us.<br>  There's no way we're asking  these neighbors for a cup of sugar.<br>  DETMER: Captain to the bridge.<br>  Incoming vessel.<br>  - It's the Cooper.<br> - We're on our way.<br>  BRYCE: We're being hailed, sir.<br>  They're asking to speak with the captain.<br>  They think we're their Discovery.<br>  All right, what intel do we have?  Scanning records from the core download.<br>  Uh, wait.<br> The rebel logs  show their ships being attacked  by a vessel with a warp signature  matching our Discovery,  but with a quantum signature  matching this universe.<br>  They're hailing us again, sir.<br>  That signature seems to have vanished  at the same coordinates where we popped in.<br>  - So - It is possible  we switched places with their Discovery.<br>  I'm gonna run with Mr.<br> Saru's theory in the hope  that we don't bump into ourselves and blow our cover.<br>  - Burnham.<br> - Modifying our ship's  signature to match that of mirror Discovery.<br>  - BRYCE: Captain.<br> They're saying - Hold on, Lieutenant!  if we don't respond that we should prepare to be fired on.<br>  Open a channel.<br> Audio only.<br>  Belay that.<br>  I'm sorry, but you can't take it, sir.<br>  I'm examining the crew manifest of mirror Discovery.<br>  You're not its captain.<br>  Who is?

This is Captain Spoeneman.<br> Why the delay  in responding, Discovery?  I was indisposed.<br>  Everything okay over there, Discovery? You made quick work  of those rebels, and we got the stragglers.<br>  Any reason you're still hanging around?  Expecting more kills? Trying to keep them all to yourself?

Here's my chief engineer.<br>  I don't know who you are over here just yet,  so conceal your voice just in case.<br>  [WITH SCOTTISH ACCENT.]<br>: How are you doing, Captain?  Everything's squared away here.<br>  We've got, uh we've got trouble with our visual emitters  and the starboard nacelle, but  a bit tweaking, we'll be good to go, all right?  Very well, Discovery.<br>  More rebel nests for us.<br> Happy hunting.<br>  Long live the Empire!

Well, that's not very clever.<br>  LORCA: Our very survival relies on our ability to maintain this cover.<br>  No matter what.<br>  We are now the ISS Discovery.<br>  Are we civilians?  Do we get uniforms? What?  We won't be needing them, sir.<br>  I finally found the files on our Terran counterparts.<br>  We're not here.<br>  Where are we?  I'm presumed dead.<br>  And you're a fugitive wanted for my murder.<br>  Well, what happened?  Well, the intelligence is fragmented.<br>  Looks like most of it's been stolen  from classified Terran files.<br>  But it appears  that you and I both enjoyed immense prestige here.<br>  I was the captain of the Shenzhou.<br>  And you had the Buran here, too, sir.<br>  And my crew they alive?  No.<br>  You attempted a coup against the emperor.<br>  I was sent to stop you.<br>  In the process, my shuttle was destroyed  by one of your followers, and I was killed.<br>  And the emperor laid waste to your ship in retaliation.<br>  It's believed you escaped.<br>  [SIGHS.]<br> Well, there's me hoping  I'd find a better version of myself over here.<br>  Look out there.<br>  Come on.<br>  Amazing, isn't it?  Different universe, but somehow the same people  had a way to find each other.<br>  The strongest argument  I've ever seen for the existence of destiny.<br>  I'm not sure if I believe in destiny.<br>  Well, is that so?  Sitting in that cell all alone,  facing a life sentence of solitude,  future full of misery.<br>  A little part of you had to know  that wasn't the end of your story.<br>  You were destined for something more.<br>  Destiny didn't get me out of prison, Captain.<br>  You did that.<br>  Well, let's agree to disagree for now.<br>  So, who is this emperor?  There's no information in the rebel files  beyond the fact that the emperor is savage.<br>  Maybe it's not a bad thing that you and I are ghosts.<br>  I found something curious in the data here.<br>  A potential way home.<br>  I didn't know how to exploit it till right now,  but I think you might end up saving us all.<br>  SARU: It's a suicide mission.<br>  - No, listen, Commander.<br> - Data from rebel intelligence suggests  that we're not the first ship  from our universe to find ourselves here.<br>  It cites another Starfleet vessel USS Defiant.<br>  SARU: How is that possible?  At last review, the Defiant was patrolling  Sector six in our universe.<br>  There may be some kind of temporal anomaly at play.<br>  It's unclear, but data suggests that in the future,  Defiant will encounter a phenomenon that'll bring it  into this alternative universe's past.<br>  Regardless, the Defiant is a Constitution class vessel.<br>  It didn't get here by spore drive.<br>  If we find out how it did make it over,  could be our way home.<br>  But boarding the ISS Shenzhou?  Posing as your Terran selves?  Well, that plan is an invitation for calamity.<br>  Captain, I beg you to reconsider.<br>  Intel on the Defiant is classified.<br>  It's only available on a Terran ship  to those with high-level clearance.<br>  - Like a captain.<br> - But you are an enemy of the empire and  - no longer a captain, Captain.<br> - No, but I am.<br>  But I thought the other Burnham was dead.<br>  Presumed dead.<br> My body was never found.<br>  I'm responsible for her death.<br>  And I'm still at large.<br> So, Captain Burnham  will be returning to the Shenzhou,  - with me as bounty.<br> - And I'll explain  that my death was a cover that I used to hunt him to the end  - of the quadrant.<br> - Delightful.<br>  We beam over,  Burnham gets the info on Defiant,  we beam back.<br> Simple.<br>  Every captain in the empire has a personal guard.<br>  You're gonna be Burnham's.<br>  Am I?  Have long-range sensors scan  for the ISS Shenzhou.<br> When you find her,  plot an intercept course.<br>  [SIGHS.]<br>  Let's get us home.<br>  Yes, sir.<br>  CULBER: What exactly are you worried about, Lieutenant?  I just want you to make sure  the Klingons didn't do something to me.<br>  Some kind of procedure I don't know about.<br>  Well, of course, you know, anything is possible.<br>  But you were exposed to a full set of physical scans  when you came on board.<br>  And random memory sampling, the Manchurian test,  is highly effective at detecting  what used to be called brainwashing,  i.<br>e.<br> the installation of commands  or personality engrams  underneath a functioning consciousness.<br>  What exactly are you imagining they could have done to you?  I'm not imagining anything.<br>  Forgive me, Lieutenant.<br>  I meant the word practically, not pejoratively.<br>  As in when one uses the imagination  to picture what is not yet known.<br>  Or seen.<br>  [EXHALES.]<br>  Are you suffering from mood swings?  Fugue states? Lost time?  If any of that is the case,  I'll have to ground you.<br>  [CHUCKLES.]<br> I just want to make sure  I'm shipshape before this mission.<br>  The people on this ship, they saved my life.<br>  I won't let 'em down.<br>  Well, let me run a deeper set of scans.<br>  What you probably need most right now is rest  and some time off of this ship.<br>  Not much chance of that, Doc.<br>  Stay out of the palace!  I'll just be a minute.<br>  Paul, I'm not going anywhere.<br>  I'm gonna stay right by your side.<br>  It'll be okay.<br>  [WHISPERS.]<br>: Be careful.<br> The enemy is here.<br>  I'd say, um, I'm 60% excited,  40% terrified.<br>  Actually, it's 60% terrified, 40% excited.<br>  - Maybe it's 70% - Tilly.<br>  Sorry.<br> Sorry.<br>  And stop apologizing.<br>  Terrans don't apologize.<br>  Well, my mother would definitely approve.<br>  Computer, cancel mirror.<br>  You are a captain now.<br>  No, I'm not.<br> She is.<br>  I'm nothing like her, Michael.<br>  She's terrifying.<br> She's-she's like a twisted version  of everything I've ever aspired to be.<br>  I'm gonna have nightmares about myself now.<br>  You don't actually have to be her.<br>  But how do I project that strength?  I've been trying to understand them better.<br>  And Terran strength is born out of pure necessity.<br>  Because they live in constant fear,  always looking for the next knife aimed at their back.<br>  Their strength is painted rust.<br>  It's a facade.<br>  But you have the strength of an entire crew  that believes in you.<br>  Fortify yourself with our faith in you.<br>  That's what a real captain does.<br>  [DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN.]<br>  Impressive.<br>  Well, let's not keep these assholes waiting.<br>  Too much?  No.<br>  Not here.<br>  Here, it's just right.<br>  Mr.<br> Bryce.<br>  - Yes, Captain.<br> - Hail the ISS Shenzhou.<br>  Now.<br>  Aye, Captain.<br>  This is the ISS Discovery  hailing the ISS Shenzhou.<br>  Shenzhou, do you read? Over.<br>  Captain Tilly.<br>  To what do I owe the pleasure?  And how can I return the favor?  The only pleasure I take is from the blood of my enemies  staining my uniform,  Captain Connor.<br>  You know him?  He was my ops officer on the Shenzhou.<br>  I watched him die at the Battle of the Binary Stars.<br>  I knew we'd encounter familiar faces.<br>  But is this what it's gonna be like here?  While scouring the asteroid belts of Porathia,  searching for hidden rebels,  I happened to come across a disabled shuttle.<br>  Inside, I found something  I think you'll find most interesting.<br>  [GRUNTING.]<br>  Showtime.<br>  Captain Burnham.<br>  We-we thought you were  You thought exactly what I wanted you  and everyone else to think.<br>  Especially him.<br>  It was the only way I could capture this traitor.<br>  Most ingenious.<br>  I don't need your compliments, Connor.<br>  I need my ship.<br>  Of course.<br>  I expect you've kept her in perfect condition?  Yes, Captain.<br>  Then bring her to me.<br>  We have a rebel group pinned down in this system.<br>  It would be better if you come to us.<br>  Is that how you treat your long-lost captain?  If you greeted me that way, Connor,  I'd cut out your tongue and use it to lick my boots.<br>  We will alter course  to the Discovery at once, Captain Burnham,  and prepare for your arrival.<br>  Be sure that you do.<br>  [SOFT CRACKLING.]<br>  [EXHALES.]<br>  [EXHALES.]<br>  You called, Doc?  - You find anything? - Yeah.<br> Um  have you ever received any  neurological therapies  or marrow-diminution procedures before?  - No.<br> Not that I know of.<br> - 'Cause there are masses  of scar tissue surrounding all of your organs.<br>  Right.<br> From my torture.<br>  Right, that's what the computer concluded when you first came aboard.<br>  But I've run more advanced tests,  and  if I'm reading these chondroblast-cell scans correctly,  what the Klingons did to you can only be described as  bone-crushing.<br>  They opened up your limbs.<br>  And they appear to have shortened your radius,  your femurs,  even your spinal cord.<br>  - What are you getting at? - Well, this is  just a theory, Tyler, but  remember we confirmed that no personality engrams  were hidden under your native identity?  - Okay.<br> - Well  there's some research that suggests that  a new personality could be placed  atop it,  like an overlay, with  the original personality still intact underneath.<br>  It appears that the Klingons have transformed you.<br>  Both mentally and physically.<br>  Into what?  That's what we have to figure out.<br>  Doc, I came here for a solution.<br>  - Now, you said you could fix it.<br> - Please, sit down.<br>  - I'm needed on a mission! - I'm afraid you're  not going anywhere without further examination.<br>  - They need me! - Well, that's just it.<br>  As far as I'm concerned  you're not you.<br>  [MALE VOICE SPEAKING KLINGON.]<br>  [BONES BREAK.]<br>  The enemy is here.<br>  Incoming warp signature.<br>  ISS Shenzhou approaching.<br>  [MUFFLED BLAST.]<br>  [SOFTLY.]<br>: My God.<br>  [METALLIC TRILLING.]<br>  Captain, we're being hailed.<br>  Open a channel.<br>  Inform Shenzhou, three to beam over.<br>  Aye, sir.<br>  Gonna look after her.<br>  Mr.<br> Saru, you're in charge now.<br>  Well, I guess you're in charge to anybody off the ship  Captain Killy.<br>  [SIGHS.]<br>  Maintain a safe distance.<br>  Close enough to transport us back  as soon as Burnham gets her hands on the Defiant files.<br>  I won't let you down, sir.<br>  I know you won't.<br>  Tyler.<br>  Where were you?  [SIGHS.]<br>: Uh  I-I'm not sure, sir.<br>  What?  There's no excuse for my tardiness.<br>  Sorry, Captain.<br>  No more apologies.<br>  From now on, we're Terrans.<br>  Decency is weakness, will get us killed.<br>  And the lives of everyone on this ship  and in the Federation are at stake.<br>  So you do what you must.<br>  Whatever you must.<br>  To anyone.<br>  Understand?  - Aye, Captain.<br> - Clear, Captain.<br>  Guess that's the last time you're calling me "Captain.<br>"  Hopefully, just for a while.<br>  You ready?  Energize.<br>  [METALLIC TRILLING.]<br>  Captain Burnham.<br>  Welcome back to the Shenzhou.<br>  We've made some modifications.<br>  Replaced the lateral-vector transport systems.<br>  Let me take this bastard off your hands.<br>  He's due for a world of pain.<br>  Keep your hands off him.<br>  You think I'd let just anyone control the fate  of the most valuable bounty in the galaxy?  I'll take Lorca to the brig personally.<br>  There are any number of souls on board  looking to serve up his severed head for their own glory.<br>  Of course.<br> I'll escort you, Captain.<br>  [GROANS.]<br>  [ZAPPING, PEOPLE SCREAMING.]<br>  CONNOR: Only the finest agonizer booth  reserved for the treacherous Lorca.<br>  Absolutely not.<br>  CONNOR: Captain?  What did I say to you?  I do not want  some overzealous guard killing this traitor  before I have the chance.<br>  I would punish the entire ship for an error that grave!  We would never allow him the release of death, Captain.<br>  [EXHALES.]<br>  See to it that he is installed properly here.<br>  I need to access my files.<br>  Escort me to the ready room.<br>  [MAN SCREAMING.]<br>  [SCREAMS.]<br>  You know, I almost didn't make it to captain  after you were gone.<br>  But I still came out on top.<br>  The emperor saw something in me.<br>  Glad to hear it.<br>  The crew  they all bowed after I won.<br>  But they didn't bow deeply enough.<br>  Not like they did with you.<br>  I needed to make them fear me.<br>  And now I finally think I know how.<br>  [BOTH GRUNTING.]<br>  I don't need a blade to kill you, Captain.<br>  [BOTH GRUNTING.]<br>  [PANTING.]<br>    The chair is yours, Captain.<br>  Dispose of him.<br>  With pleasure, sir.<br>  BRIDGE CREW: Long live Captain Burnham!
