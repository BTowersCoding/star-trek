The Michael Burnham on my ship.<br>  - [GRUNTS.]<br> - [GASPS.]<br>  Eight thousand one hundred and eighty-six.<br>  I would like to extend an official invitation  to you to join the Discovery.<br>  We are creating a new way to fly.<br>  An organic propulsion system.<br>  Hold tight.<br>  You're in Ilari.<br> The moons of Andoria.<br>  All those planets, all those places,  (SNAPS) and you're home like it never happened.<br>  [BURNHAM.]<br> What the hell could do this to a dozen Klingons?  - [SNARLING.]<br> - [KLINGON GRUNTS.]<br>  [BURNHAM.]<br> Run.<br>  [LANDRY.]<br> Set phasers to kill!  [MAN YELLS.]<br>  [LORCA.]<br> So, is our new guest settled in?

I'm sorry, I didn't know.<br>  [MAN OVER PA.]<br> Michael Burnham to the bridge.<br>  [CASE BEEPS.]<br>  [BURNHAM.]<br> I'll see you in engineering.<br>  [CHATTERING.]<br>  [DOOR BEEPS.]<br>  [DOORS SLIDE SHUT.]<br>  Bridge.<br> Direct.<br>  [TURBOLIFT HUMMING.]<br>  As first officer, I take pride in knowing every name  and assignment on the crew manifest.<br>  You were to be on the prison transport shuttle  that left yesterday.<br>  Captain Lorca offered me an opportunity.<br>  I can tell by your threat ganglia that you weren't consulted.<br>  The captain keeps his own counsel.<br>  Had he inquired,  I'd have suggested the duty roster  lacked any opening for a mutineer.<br>  "A valuable asset.<br>"  - That's what you called me.<br> - I was speaking hypothetically.<br>  Politely.<br>  And as someone who was certain I would never see you again.<br>  You can tell your threat ganglia to relax.<br>  I'm only here to help.<br>  My ganglia remain unconvinced.<br>  [ALARM WAILING.]<br>  [LORCA.]<br> Scanners.<br> Expedite my targeting sweep.<br> Multi-spectrum.<br>  - Laterals included.<br> - [OWOSEKUN.]<br> Aye, sir.<br>  Scanners confirm two Klingon Birds-of-Prey.<br>  Targets heading away at offset vectors.<br>  Charge main phasers to full.<br>  Let's take 'em out before they know we're here.<br>  Charging.<br>  - Vectors received.<br> - We've been located are being scanned.<br>  Keep the warp engines topped hot.<br> Landry, we're waiting.<br>  Solution calculated.<br> Firing main phasers.<br>  [LANDRY.]<br> First target destroyed.<br>  - Second Bird-of-Prey still in.<br> - [LORCA.]<br> Take it out!  - They're firing torpedoes.<br> - Shields to max.<br>  - Diverting power.<br> - [LORCA.]<br> Commander.<br>  We're all dead.<br>  Very nice.<br>  Very polite.<br>  The Discovery is now the only Starfleet ship  with a displacement-activated spore hub drive.<br>  Which means, when it's up and running,  we will be able to materialize anywhere in the known universe.<br>  Behind enemy lines, above the Klingon homeworld.<br>  Anywhere.<br>  But we will be alone.<br>  We will not have backup.<br>  There's just us.<br>  And we get one chance  to get it right.<br>  We'll do better next time, sir.<br>  It would be hard to do worse.<br>  Mr.<br> Saru, run the simulation again.<br> And again.<br>  - Burnham, with me.<br> - [SARU.]<br> You heard the captain.<br>  Computer, reload simulation.<br>  [COMPUTER.]<br> Working.<br>  [LORCA.]<br> We're the tip of the spear in a science vessel  filled with wide-eyed explorers.<br>  - You know what they need us to do? - [BURNHAM.]<br> They need us to win.<br>  [LORCA.]<br> They need us to survive,  Burnham.<br>  Wanna know how you're gonna help me do that?  I'm happy to assist Lieutenant Stamets  with the refinement of the spore drive.<br>  Said the xenoanthropologist.<br>  I also studied quantum mechanics at the Vulcan Science Academy, sir.<br>  I know.<br> But I'm gonna put you to better use.<br>  These are some of the deadliest weapons in the galaxy.<br>  I study war.<br>  And this is where I hone my craft.<br>  I try to learn from the best.<br>  Here.<br>  Now this I think you'll find uniquely interesting.<br>  You've met once before.<br>  [CREATURE GROWLING.]<br>  - [ROARS.]<br> - [EXHALES.]<br>  It has a natural aversion to light.<br>  Same as me.<br>  Why would you keep something so dangerous onboard your own ship?  That thing killed a dozen Klingons on the Glenn,  and there's not a scratch on it from their bat'leths.<br>  If we're gonna win this thing,  if we're gonna have a chance of saving the Federation  and everyone in it,  we need the best weapons available.<br>  So, what material is in a claw  that can shred the hull of a ship?  What's a hide made of that can withstand  the firepower of a phaser set to kill?  I need you to find out.<br>  And weaponize it.<br>  [THEME MUSIC PLAYING.]<br>   [MEN ARGUING INDISTINCTLY IN KLINGON.]<br>  [IN KLINGON.]<br>  [IN KLINGON.]<br>  [COMPUTER.]<br> Scans indicate a diet likely based on  foraging for vegetation  or other passive means of obtaining nutrition.<br>  [DOORS OPEN.]<br>  Lorca thought you and I would make a good team.<br>  Your science.<br> My tactics.<br>  Together we can deal with Lorca's little monster.<br>  How do you know it's a monster, Commander?

I told you we'd be ready when you called, and we are.<br>  Discovery's made dozens of small jumps with no issues.<br>  We can make it the full distance.<br>  You have no doubts?  None.<br>  There's no way we'll be ready to jump that far.<br>  You told me you knew why the Glenn failed.<br>  The Glenn crashed into an undetectable Hawking radiation firewall  when it exited from a mycelial plane.<br>  As a result, all the biologicals onboard spun out.<br>  You can prevent that from happening again, right?  - [STAMETS.]<br> Yes.<br> - So what's the problem?  Captain, as I've explained to you, every time we try a long jump,  we lose navigational stability.<br>  Remember? Jumping is probabilistic.<br>  The longer the jump, the more possible outcomes.<br>  I get it.<br> It's trial and error.<br> Let's try something.<br>  We lack the processing power to make the requisite number  of calculations to hold a course.<br>  What were they doing that we're not?  We took this tech from Straal's lab on the Glenn.<br>  It was an augmentation to their navigation system.<br>  I've incorporated it into our drive unit.<br>  But it won't load completely.<br>  To function optimally,  it would appear to require some kind of supercomputer.<br>  Must've missed that on the Glenn.<br>  Sir  being chased by a lethal monster  in a death trap surrounded by Klingon bodies is distracting,  but, no, I would've noticed an extra supercomputer.<br>  That's just me.<br>  What's that thing?  That thing is what we took off the Glenn.<br>  It interacts with the spore drive somehow,  but I think it's missing a part.<br> I can't get it to activate.<br>  [SARU CLEARS THROAT.]<br>  In exactly five hours, 49 minutes and 46 seconds,  the Klingons will take Corvan 2.<br>  Captain, this can't be rushed.<br>  You listen to me, Mr.<br> Stamets.<br>  They need us.<br> Now.<br>  There are some things I could try to extend the jump range.<br>  Get it done.<br>  You're welcome.<br>  [IN KLINGON.]<br>  [KOL IN KLINGON.]<br>  [ALL.]<br>  [STAMETS.]<br> Captain, be advised, the spore drive is online and primed.<br>  [LORCA.]<br> Primed?

I warned you, Captain.<br>  Time is an essential component of good science.<br>  Discovery is no longer a science vessel.<br>  - It's a warship.<br> - That is not the mission I signed on for.<br>  - I'm not a soldier.<br> - Well, then get off.<br>  Leave the ship.<br>  If I go, I'm taking everything with me.<br>  My spores, my drive.<br>  This entire ship was designed around my scientific specialty.<br>  Everything on this ship is the property of Starfleet, Lieutenant.<br>  How do you wanna be remembered in history?
