                    			[Burnham.]<br> Previously on Star Trek: Discovery:  That's a Federation distress signal.<br>  A distress signal must include an encoded message of some kind.<br>  Adira can write an algorithm that can decode it.<br>  Update me the moment you have something.<br>  What the Federation's done for us, for other worlds like ours, I want in.<br>  Well, you'll have to speak to Captain Saru,  and clarify your intentions aboard his starship.<br>  Aye, aye.<br>  - One aye.<br> - One aye, yeah.<br>  I would like you to serve as my acting first officer.<br>  Saru made the right choice.<br>  The sphere data was transmitted here for us to protect it.<br>  [computer.]<br> Your crew requires R&R, captain.<br>  Perhaps now, it desires to protect us.<br>  She's redlining.<br>  I'm dying.<br>  It's not that cut and dry.<br>  [dramatic music playing.]<br>  [Kovich.]<br> If you'd come to me sooner, I could have saved you a lot of trouble.<br>  - I wasn't aware you had medical training.<br> - I'm a man of widely varying interests.<br>  I understand she's been presenting with physiological symptoms,  but the cure won't be found anywhere in this room,  or in this galaxy, for that matter.<br>  Computer, open classified file Beta-4895-Omega.<br>  Lieutenant Commander Yor, deceased.<br>  - Time soldier.<br> - Time soldier?  You're lucky you skipped the Temporal Wars.<br>  Amongst the many horrible things we discovered when weaponizing time,  temporal travel can make you sick.<br>  Our molecules are designed to function in the time in which they're created.<br>  But everyone on Discovery traveled through time.<br>  Yes, but only one of you is also from a parallel universe.<br>  Yor here traveled forward from 2379  and across from an alternate universe created by the temporal incursion  of a Romulan mining ship.<br>  Before Georgiou, Yor was the only individual known  to have traveled across both time and dimensions.<br>  - You knew this would happen to her? - Suspected.<br>  Every molecule fights to either go back in time  or jump a cosmic divide.<br>  By the end, Yor was in such pain,  the doctors petitioned the Federation for euthanasia.<br>  They couldn't send him back to his own universe?  Not without breaking the Interdimensional Displacement Restriction  part of the Temporal Accords, which are ironclad.<br>  But Georgiou didn't get sick when she first crossed to prime.<br>  Nine hundred years have passed.<br>  The prime and mirror universes have been drifting apart.<br>  Yor's experience was a breeze compared with what Georgiou's about to face.<br>  Well, thank you.<br>  - I'll tell her what's happening.<br> - No, you won't.<br>  A dying Terran's basic instinct  is to find a way to die in battle, the more glorious the better.<br>  You wanna set that loose on your ship?  The best thing you could do is sedate her and put her in a comfortable cell.<br>  Computer, incorporating new data,  is there another solution to help Georgiou?  Include datasets from before we jumped to the future and after.<br>  This is pointless.<br>  - There is absolutely no - There is a solution.<br>  Show us.<br>  [clears throat.]<br>  Well, if it isn't Saru's walking command blunder.<br>  Find a way to kill everyone onboard yet?  Maybe they'll call you "Killy" after all.<br>  If you're struggling with everyday tasks, we can help you  privately.<br>  What are you insinuating?  I saw that your hand  My hand is fine.<br>  - [gasps.]<br> - See?  Where I'm from, wars would have started over much less.<br>  Thankfully, we're not there.<br>  Culber's asking for you.<br>  [Georgiou.]<br> Let me guess.<br>  He has found another way to say he has no idea what's happening to me.<br>  No, there's been a development.<br>  It won't matter.<br>  If I were you, I'd find a phaser and put me down like a dog.<br>  [Culber.]<br> Apparently, the cure can be found on Dannus Five.<br>  Every time we query the sphere data for a treatment,  no matter how we entered it, it gave us the same result.<br>  But your computer merged with a sentient intelligence.<br>  It's great for movie night, doesn't mean we should trust it.<br>  It was bringing the crew together helping them.<br>  Maybe it's trying to help one of our own.<br>  Discovery's computer has acquired all current Federation databases,  in addition to those from our original time,  databases that were lost or damaged in the Burn.<br>  It has a scope and context we can't conceive of.<br>  What are the odds we're talking about here?  [Culber.]<br> According to the computer's metadata analysis of probabilities,  Georgiou has a 5 percent chance of survival if we take her there,  zero if we don't.<br>  Emperor Georgiou and I have not always seen eye to eye,  yet I am sympathetic to her plight.<br>  That said, I regret that this is an instance  wherein the needs of the many must outweigh the needs of the one.<br>  Sir?  We have received reports that the Emerald Chain is about to conduct  the equivalent of military exercises as they did near Argeth.<br>  The entire fleet is being placed on yellow alert, commander.<br>  Where is this planet again?  Just shy of the Gamma Quadrant, near the Galactic Rim.<br>  [suspenseful music playing.]<br>  So, nowhere near the Chain.<br>  Georgiou will be a menace to any civilization she runs across.<br>  Dannus Five is uninhabited.<br>  Well, an uninhabited planet is better than the brig.<br>  If we don't find a cure there  I doubt she'll even make it back to Discovery.<br>  All right.<br> I'll authorize it.<br>  Providing Burnham can answer a question for me.<br>  Yes, sir.<br>  Will you really be able to let her go, when it comes down to it?  Because the odds are not good here.<br>  According to your files, you hesitated last time.<br>  Couldn't make the hard call.<br>  - You're referring to Commander Airiam.<br> - Your entire crew would have died.<br>  Which is why I will never hesitate again.<br>  Sir.<br>  Disclosure to crew will be need-to-know  at Captain Saru's discretion.<br>  Dismissed.<br>  [dramatic music playing.]<br>  Captain Saru, a word?  Not what you would have done?  Given my understanding of the Federation's priorities,  I would have made a different choice, yes.<br>  I never listened to  advice when I was green,  but take it from an old salt who's made  a lot of bad calls in his day.<br>  A crew member is drowning.<br>  If we let her,  then your crew will never look at you or the Federation the same way again.<br>  And you will never look at yourself the same way, either.<br>  Yes, sir.<br>  And  thank you, sir.<br>  We'll deal with the Chain.<br>  See you when you get back.<br>  -

Right here.<br>  [computer chimes.]<br>  I just cost us so much time.<br>  You're tired.<br>  You haven't slept.<br>  You're angry with Gray.<br>  Uh, I'm not angry.<br> [scoffs.]<br>  - It's okay to miss him.<br> - I don't miss him.<br>  The last few weeks have been great.<br>  Yeah, I am enjoying my life without him  and if he was here right now,  I would thank him for leaving without a word.<br>  Maybe he's doing what he thinks is best.<br>  He did say that he wants you to make ties with the outside world, right?  Yeah, but he doesn't get to decide what's good for me.<br>  No.<br>  He doesn't.<br>  [computer.]<br> Video rendering complete.<br>  [suspenseful music playing.]<br>  What the?  [gasps.]<br> Is that?  Go find Saru.<br>  Okay.<br> Um  Yeah, okay.<br>  [Booker.]<br> Hey, captain, a word?  If you do not mind talking on the move, Mr.<br> Booker.<br>  Yeah, sure.<br> Look, I wanna thank you again for what you did on Kwejian.<br>  No need.<br> It's the reason for the Federation's existence.<br>  That's what I wanted to talk to you about.<br>  - I think I can help you.<br> - Help?  I wanna stick around for a bit and I plan to earn my way.<br>  I'm not sure if you heard, but I'm a skilled pilot, an engineer,  and I have information.<br>  I'm listening.<br>  I'm hearing the Emerald Chain is getting ready for, uh, "training exercises.<br>"  Only most times it's not the training.<br>  That confirms intelligence we've already received.<br>  -

Did you do that? - It's not my work.<br>  We're here for a reason, so do something.<br> Help her.<br>  [groans.]<br>  You're antagonizing me because you're pissed at her.<br>  Am I right?  [bio-scanner beeping.]<br>  [grunting.]<br>  You really should just read the paper.<br>  Everything you need is right here.<br>  That infernal paper says I'm dead.<br>  -
