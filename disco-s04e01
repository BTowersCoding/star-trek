Yeah, that's Grudge.<br> - Grudge?  Felis catus, a domestic species  of small carnivorous mammal.<br>  You claim to understand our culture,  yet you bring a carnivore to our world?  Domestic.<br> I said domestic.<br>  She's my pet.<br> She lives on my ship.<br>  I feed her, love her, give her cat treats.<br>  Is she grateful?  No.<br> No.<br>  - In no way.<br> - It's bad attitude.<br>  Yet you expect us to be.<br>  - No.<br> Oh, no, no, no.<br> - (LAUGHS)  - Have you come to make pets of us? - BURNHAM: We haven't come  - to make you anything.<br> - You've got the wrong idea.<br>  - D - Let me explain.<br>  - Uh, she's a queen.<br> - She's a queen.<br>  You hold a Monarch captive?  Oh, no.<br> No, no, no, no.<br>  - Oh, Emperor Lee'U - No, it is not like that.<br>  -  we have the utmost respect - I don't  - for-for you, for - Absolutely.<br> For sure.<br>  This is bad.<br> This is really bad.<br>  Okay, so do your empathy thing.<br>  - My what? - Your  your empathy thing, right-right now.<br>  I brought you here to connect with them.<br>  I don't think they want to connect.<br>  You will take us to your ship.<br>  We will free the queen.<br>  - Oh - Yup.<br> Time to go.<br>  (WEAPONS FIRING)  BURNHAM: They're not gonna be happy when they see  - a massive starship.<br> - BOOK: They're not going to.<br>  - What? - It wouldn't fit through the trees.<br>  I'm sending the little guy.<br>  - And it'll be here in time? - We're about to find out.<br>  BURNHAM: Oh, why is there always a cliff?  (BOTH GROAN)  (BOOK WHOOPS)  BOOK: Why did you say "carnivore" to the butterfly people?  BURNHAM: They are not butterfly people.<br>  Why do you even have a pet?  Why don't you just have a hologram goldfish?  BOOK: I had one.<br> Grudge ate it.<br>  BURNHAM: Who eats a hologram?  The butterflies are shooting at us.<br> Bring up weapons system.<br>  No.<br> No, do not fire back.<br> This is a diplomatic mission.<br>  Then I'm beaming us out of here.<br>  No, we have to give them dilithium.<br>  They don't want it!  If we leave now, they will never trust the Federation again.<br>  Or we'll come back when they're in a better mood.<br>  - Why haven't they hit us? - What?  The Alshain.<br> At this range, they should have hit us by now.<br>  - And that's a problem? - RHYS: Captain,  sensors have you moving erratically.<br> Everything okay?  - Yup.<br> Just negotiating.<br> - Uh, about to hit a tree.<br>  - Hang on!
