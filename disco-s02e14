                    			1  Previously on Star Trek: Discovery  CORNWELL: Control will not stop coming.<br>  Eventually, Leland will find you.<br>  SPOCK: Ergo, Discovery's very existence is the problem.<br>  Discovery's shields are up.<br>  It's protecting itself.<br>  Sphere's data has already merged with Discovery.<br>  - Options.<br> - We know we can't delete the data.<br>  Nor, it seems, can we destroy Discovery.<br>  As long as Discovery exists here and now,  this will never be over.<br>  Discovery has to go to the future.<br>  SARU: We have the technical designs from Section 31.<br>  - We can attempt to rebuild it.<br> - Do it.<br>  Once the Enterprise catches up with us, I'll be joining them.<br>  I hope though you're happy, Hugh.<br>  NICOLA (OVER COMM): Admiral, Captain Pike,  there's something you need to see.<br>  And then there were five.<br>  Commander Stamets, you will jump us to that signal.<br>  BURNHAM: Class M planet, Xahea.<br>  Really? Xahea?  - Tilly! - (LAUGHING)  I know the queen of Xahea.<br>  So, you want to use the suit to travel through time  - with this ship flying behind you, yes? - Yes.<br>  There is just one problem.<br>  Continuous regeneration of energy will ultimately burn out the crystal.<br>  It's a one-way trip.<br>  You're not coming, are you?  I wish I could say yes.<br>  DETMER: Attention, all vessels.<br>  Leland's fleet has arrived.<br>  PIKE: Leland and his ships will give us one hell of a fight.<br>  BURNHAM: We are surrounded.<br>  All enemy vessels armed and ready.<br>  - Shields up.<br> - Prepare for battle.<br>  (ALARMS BLARING)  Battle stations, report.<br>  Shields at maximum, sir.<br>  Weapons armed and ready, Captain.<br>  Transmit to all ships.<br>  (OVER COMM): This is Captain Pike.<br>  We have one job:  get Commander Burnham and Discovery through the wormhole.<br>  (FRANTIC CHATTER)  Section 31 is in our way.<br>  (OVERLAPPING CHATTER OVER COMMS)  PIKE: Once Burnham launches in the suit,  Second Squadron will match course and speed  to cover her and defend her perimeter.<br>  Squadrons Three and Four will be the front line of defense  against the Section 31 fleet.<br>  You will lead the attack and draw their fire  to give us the time we need.<br>  Enterprise will maintain fire on the fleet  to cause distraction for as long as we can.<br>  But as soon as Burnham is detected out there,  we have to keep her safe.<br>  (OVERLAPPING CHATTER OVER COMMS)  PIKE: All shuttles and pods, use attack formation Gamma Six.<br>  Squadrons One and Three, coordinate positions  to disrupt and target all main enemy vessels.<br>  This is Starfleet.<br>  Get it done.<br>  Mr.<br> Saru, ETA on that suit.<br>  The components are being synthesized  and assembled as we speak.<br>  BURNHAM: Don't adjust the composite automatically.<br>  I'll do it manually after each piece is cleared for assembly.<br>  I'm not detecting any micro-variances.<br>  No, I need a surgical spanner,  not a standard engineering coupler.<br>  Stop.<br> Look me in the eyes.<br>  The silicon injectors need to be purged  after each binding is molded.<br> Watch me.<br>  The bayonet joint on this oxygen sensor's wide open.<br>  Are you trying to kill her?  - Oh, shit.<br> - Get off the assembly.<br>  - I got it.<br> - Sorry, Commander.<br>  High speed, low drag, Commander.<br> The longer it takes her  to open that wormhole, the fewer make it home.<br>  SARU (OVER COMM): Yes, sir.<br>  What's the intel on how much perimeter space she'll need  to get far enough away from that wormhole?  Commander Burnham needs to remain  at the outermost radius of the battle  - at .<br>0004 arc-seconds.<br> - In English, please.<br>  I can't blow a path through what you're saying.<br>  Tight enough so none of the Section 31 ships  get pulled into the future, loose enough so none of our guys  get destroyed by the event horizon.<br>  Lieutenant Spock will remain on comms throughout to guide her.<br>  Reno, where are we with the time crystal?  Four minutes, 18 seconds away until fully charged.<br>  Can you cut that in half?  Violate the basic laws of physics?  Uh, no.<br>  Commander, we've scanned the Section 31 armada.<br>  There's only one life sign: Captain Leland's.<br>  The rest of the ships are empty.<br>  Drones.<br> Nasty ones.<br>  Lieutenant Bryce, have you had any success reaching Starfleet?  Subspace relays are still down, Commander.<br>  - Attempting to circumvent, - but we're still being jammed.<br>  It is just us.<br>  Any, uh, words of wisdom?  "Be extremely subtle,  even to the point of formlessness.<br>  Be extremely mysterious,  even to the point of soundlessness.<br>"  "Thereby you can be the director of your opponent's fate.<br>"  I'm surprised a Kelpien, of all beings,  has studied Sun Tzu.<br>  I am surprised a Terran is surprised by anything.<br>  BRYCE: Incoming hail.<br>  It's Leland, sir.<br>  You will see a human face.<br>  It is not a human being.<br>  Am I clear?  - ALL: Yes, sir.<br> - Put it through.<br>  Leland, we were just talking about you.<br>  Everybody hates you.<br>  Congratulations.<br>  LELAND: You know why I'm here.<br>  Give me what I've come for,  or die for it.<br>  By authority granted me under the Articles of the Federation  and Starfleet Charter,  I order you to surrender your vessels.<br>  No terms, no deals.<br>  LELAND: Last warning.<br>  Transmit the data to me,  or you'll be destroyed.<br>  By my count, we have over 200 vessels,  and you might have 30.<br>  Count again.<br>    (ALARM BLARING)        (ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS)  (OVERLAPPING CHATTER OVER COMMS)  (FRANTIC CHATTER)  (ALARM BLARING)  Multiple torpedoes locked on us.<br>  - Evasive pattern Delta Five.<br> - Aye, sir.<br>  All power to forward shields.<br> Fire full spread.<br>  - Damage report.<br> - Breach in section two.<br>  Decks nine and ten.<br> Seven confirmed dead.<br>  Shields at 86%.<br>  Shields at 82%.<br>  We have a breach on deck 12.<br>  Emergency bulkheads engaged successfully.<br>  - I've got a leg panel.<br> - Back plate complete.<br>  We need an adjustment on 1.<br>0, 2.<br>3 and 4.<br>2.<br>  I'm on it.<br> I got it.<br>  Reno, we need that time crystal now.<br>  One minute away.<br> Charge at 98%.<br>  (GRUNTS)  All squadrons on those drones immediately!  Captain Pike, it's Po.<br> Do you copy?  Pull her up.<br>  She's flying directly beneath them.<br>  Give me her shuttle feed.<br>  Your Highness,  uh, who told you you could fly a Federation vessel?  First, I invoke diplomatic immunity for stealing this shuttle.<br>  All due respect, Your Highness, get out of there.<br>  Captain, listen, your squadron's gonna get obliterated.<br>  What?
