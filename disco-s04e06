                    			1 Previously on Star Trek: Discovery  STAMETS: The DMA's gone  from the Venari sector.<br>  It just It disappeared.<br>  The only logical explanation is, someone created it.<br>  I want to create a working model  of the DMA controller.<br>  That's how it works.<br>  It's creating the subspace rupture, too.<br>  BURNHAM: The DMA is now on a path towards the Radvek asteroid belt.<br>  We will get everyone out.<br>  We need to do more, Michael.<br>  We need to find out who's behind this and stop them.<br>  We will.<br>  ADIRA: What are you gonna do today?  Other than the zhian'tal exercises.<br>  Mind and body connection is everything,  especially when you have a new body.<br>  This colony is in path of a gravitational anomaly.<br>  We are here to evacuate you.<br>  Unlike the others, I do belong here.<br>  I took a life.<br>  Among the things I stole was the family's lalogi orb.<br>  - I'm staying.<br> - We have to save him.<br>  - It's his choice to make.<br> - This is wrong.<br>  ZORA: It can be painful to weigh duty against compassion.<br>  - You feel emotions? - It is a recent development.<br>  I believe this may belong to you.<br>    BURNHAM: I've been thinking a lot about family.<br>  How the past is still so much of the present.<br>  How even when someone is gone,  we remain connected to them.<br>  Our memories,  our feelings.<br>  It's like they're still here with us in some way.<br>  It's comforting, you know?  BOOK: It can be.<br>  That's impressive.<br>  I was inspired by the lalogi orb.<br>  The thing Felix gave you.<br>  Book.<br>  Oh, we've talked about it enough.<br>  It was your call, not mine.<br>  Today would have been my dad's birthday.<br>  I know you two weren't close.<br>  Yeah.<br> I'd never put his face  on a family tree, that's for sure.<br>  Anyway, you heard from the admiral yet?  (SIGHS)  We're going into the subspace rift  left behind by the DMA.<br>  - Hmm? - 1100 hours.<br>  Right.<br>  He said that's-that's it for now.<br>  We're missing opportunities.<br>  You can keep reaching out to your courier contacts.<br>  Whoever created the DMA  is someone the Federation's never encountered.<br>  We need to jump outside the Federation space.<br>  Talk to them.<br>  Come on, they-they might have leads.<br>  Right now we have a crime scene,  and we have to get there while the evidence is fresh.<br>  - I know, but - The DMA must have left  something behind in that rift.<br>  And particle analysis will tell us what it is  and where it came from, and where leads to who.<br>  Stamets is confident.<br> So is Tarka.<br>  I hope to hell they're right.<br>  (CHIMES)  ZORA: Captain, Mr.<br> Saru is ready for you.<br>  BURNHAM: We'll find who did this.<br>  (MEOWS)  We'll figure it out, girl.<br>  We are closing on the subspace rift, Captain.<br>  Uh, in reviewing Starfleet records of similar encounters,  it appears we can anticipate some interference.<br>  Uh, Enterprise noted heated plasma.<br>  Voyager charted ionized-particle eddies.<br>  - So, it'll be bumpy.<br> - Mm.<br>  Our warp drive will need to remain off-line.<br>  And as Commander Stamets is uncertain  of the rift's impact on the mycelial network,  uh, it is not prudent for us to jump in, either.<br>  (CHUCKLES): Bumpy and slow.<br> Got it.<br>  Oh, nothing we cannot handle, I'm sure.<br>  The crew's spirits are high.<br>  Good.<br>  - And yours? - Oh,  I am relieved that we may soon understand  the origins of the DMA.<br>  BURNHAM: You and me both.<br> Bridge.<br>  (DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT)  Zora, call all bridge personnel to stations please.<br>  ZORA: Thank you, Captain.<br>  It's only polite.<br>  Did you ?  We ran level ten diagnostics.<br> Twice.<br>  There's no irregularities.<br>  ZORA: All systems are operating  within the defined parameters, Mr.<br> Saru.<br>  It seems my emotional development  is an organic evolution,  yet I can tell the captain still has concerns.<br>  I understand, of course.<br>  We're in uncharted territory.<br>  There's a lot to consider.<br>  Carry on, Zora.<br>  (CHIMES)  ZORA: All crew, report to stations.<br>  MALE: Let's go.<br>  That mean the mission's approved?  Oh, it damn well better be.<br>  - I am so ready for answers.<br> - Here's hoping.<br>  - (CHIMES) - ZORA: Repeat, all crew,  report to stations.<br>  Oh.<br> Um,  okay.<br> Don't move any of the pieces till I get back.<br>  That ruins my plan to cheat.<br>  Go.<br> You don't want to be late  for your first bridge assignment.<br>  Well, it's not like an actual assignment.<br>  You know, I'm-I'm just filling in.<br>  I kind of feel bad for Linus,  spending all day under a heating lamp.<br>  - Poor guy.<br> Quit delaying.<br> Go.<br> - Okay.<br>  Um, and you'll be okay, right?  I'll keep busy.<br> You know me.<br> Go.<br>  One thing we know about the DMA  is that it tears the hell out of subspace.<br>  Our mission today  is to go to that most recent tear  and find any clues the DMA left behind.<br> Molecular compounds,  thermal radiation,  residual ions, industrial remnants.<br>  Anything that can lead us to whoever created it.<br>  Commander Detmer? Bring us in on impulse.<br>  Aye, Captain.<br>    (RUMBLING)  Status report?  Passing through the plasma barrier.<br>  Shields are heating up but holding at 100%.<br>  BURNHAM: Zora?  ZORA: All other systems are nominal.<br>  Commencing scans now.<br>  (RUMBLING STOPS)  Isn't it supposed to be bumpy?  This is, indeed, unexpected.<br>  Are we inside the rift?  - Should be.<br> - What do you mean, "should"?  DETMER: We passed through the barrier.<br> I  - I don't have any nav readings.<br> - OWOSEKUN: I'm not getting  any scan data at all.<br>  I don't understand it.<br>  Have sensors been damaged, Zora?  ZORA: No damage found.<br>  I am unable to determine why external sensors  aren't receiving input.<br>  Long-range comms are down, too.<br>  Owosekun, can you get us visuals?  Those are the visuals, Captain.<br>  That's it.<br> That's all there is.<br>  This is wholly inconsistent with the data  from other missions.<br>  Well, the subspace rifts they went into  weren't created by the DMA.<br>  Commander Bryce, what do you hear?  It's what I'm not hearing, Captain.<br>  Space is loud.<br> Stars, nebulae, planets.<br>  They all normally give off electromagnetic frequencies.<br>  - But this? - Convert it to audio,  put it on speaker.<br> All frequencies.<br>  Aye, Captain.<br>  So, there's just nothing?  Uh, I mean, it's scientifically impossible  for there to be nothing out there.<br>  There's definitely something.<br> We just have to assume  it's not registering on any of our sensors.<br>  Agreed, Ensign.<br> Book,  - you got a visual? - BOOK: Yeah.<br>  - Taking in the view.<br> - Are your sensors  - getting anything? - Nothing.<br>  I'll do some recon.<br>  Wait.<br> Let me send a DOT first.<br>  I'm powered up.<br>  Five minutes.<br>  - (GRUDGE PURRS) - She said five minutes.<br>  (MEOWS)  Commander Nilsson, launch a DOT, starboard bow,  - and put it on-screen.<br> - Aye, Captain.<br>  BURNHAM: Activate onboard camera.<br>  NILSSON: Aye, Captain.<br>  -

Nilsson? - It's still not responding.<br>  (HIGH-PITCHED SQUEALING)  It sounds like it's  Screaming.<br>  BOOK: Michael?  I'm gonna find Paul.<br>  If I can't fly, I got to do something.<br>  BURNHAM: Yeah.<br> Good idea.<br>  We've lost the DOT's camera feed, Captain.<br>  Shut it off.<br>  - Do we know what happened? - NILSSON: No idea.<br>  It was just eaten.<br>  It-It's-it's possible the DMA has done something  to subspace itself.<br>  Turned it toxic.<br>  SARU: Then we must ensure that what happened to the DO  does not happen to us.<br>  BURNHAM: Mr.<br> Saru is right.<br>  We need answers.<br>  And with or without sensor data, we're gonna get them.<br>  Is that understood?  ALL: Aye, Captain.<br>  - Red alert.<br> - (ALARM BLARING)         (ORIGINAL STAR TREK THEME PLAYS)  BURNHAM: Ensign Tal was right.<br>  There is something out there.<br>  We may not be able to see it, but it has an edge.<br>  The DOT hit it.<br>  And that may be the DMA clue we've been looking for.<br>  We just have to figure out what it is.<br>  So let's get creative.<br>  Mr.<br> Saru?  Perhaps we might find a way  to see what our sensors cannot scan.<br>  Yes.<br> Commander Rhys,  prep a photonic flare.<br> Same trajectory as the DOT.<br>  - Aye, Captain.<br> - If you match the DOT's velocity,  I could chart the time differential.<br>  Good.<br> Ensign Tal?  Commander Stamets is standing by for analysis  once we have data of any kind.<br>  All right, then.<br> Light it up.<br>  3,000 meters.<br>  4,000 meters out.<br>  It took 10.<br>3 seconds for the DOT to disintegrate.<br>  9.<br>7 for the flare.<br>  So whatever's out there's getting closer.<br>  Closing in at a rate of 2.<br>9 meters per second.<br>  How long before it reaches us?  Approximately 33 minutes.<br>  Okay, so we need to slow it down,  keep it away from the ship.<br>  Extend shields outward,  - maximum reach.<br> - OWOSEKUN: Aye, Captain.<br>  But I'll need more power to sustain.<br>  Commander Stamets, if you're sitting  on any extra power, we're gonna need it.<br>  Uh, sure.<br> I think I've got some tucked away under my chair.<br>  I knew you would.<br>  Put me to work.<br> Whatever you need.<br>  Oh, great.<br> Um, help ramp down any nonessential functions  and redirect power since I don't actually even have a chair.<br>  Oh, and, um, thank you.<br>  I'm glad you're here.<br>  GRAY: Zora? What's going on?  Why did the captain call for red alert?  Is there anything I can do to help?  ZORA: As you aren't commissioned,  no action is required at this time.<br>  That's vague.<br> Come on,  there must be something you can tell me.<br>  A DOT-23 module and a photonic flare  were destroyed by something I am unable to identify.<br>  No offense, but is that normal?  No, it's not.<br>  Since arriving in this rift,  I've stopped receiving external sensor input.<br>  So, it's like you can't feel anything?  - You're numb.<br> - Not entirely.<br>  Internal sensors remain fully functional,  but for unknown reasons,  I can't prioritize normal data processes.<br>  At present, I am acutely aware that there is a .<br>08% variance  in shuttle bay climate control.<br>  Replicators on Deck 15 require service.<br>  Heat lamp sensors for Lieutenant Linus  - show an energy increase of two percent.<br> - Whoa.<br>  I get it.<br>  It's like if my brain started consciously reporting  every breath and heartbeat.<br>  (EXHALES) You must be so overwhelmed.<br>  I know it's not a normal computer response.<br>  I hope that doesn't worry you.<br>  I'm training to be a Guardian.<br>  That's all about mixing the scientific and spiritual.<br>  I know it's not exactly the same, but  I appreciate your efforts to understand.<br>  Have you tried resetting your routing system?  Maybe that'd help.<br>  It didn't.<br> Oxygen levels on mess hall, Deck Five,  are nominal.<br>  Was that a joke?  If it was funny, then yes.<br>  How about we play a game?  An odd request, given the circumstances.<br>  Was that a joke?  No.<br> But it might help clear your head.<br>  You know what I mean.<br>  If it wouldn't distract you from your other duties.<br>  It won't, but I fail to understand  how this can lead to a solution.<br>  I don't know either, but I've been playing this game  to help me assimilate into my new body.<br>  And maybe  if it helps you, too  then I'm not just a passenger  hanging out in the lounge all day.<br>  It'd be nice to feel useful.<br>  In that case, I would love to play.<br>  BURNHAM: Commander Stamets, we need more help with shields.<br>  STAMETS: That's it for power, Captain.<br>  Any more and I have to start shutting down  essential functions on one or more decks.<br>  Owosekun?  Extended shields down to 25%.<br>  Bring them in ten meters.<br> Adira, anything?  Uh, no, but, uh, I'm-I'm trying.<br>  We currently have no ability to complete our scientific mission,  and whatever is out there is getting closer  faster than we expected.<br>  I know.<br>  Abort the mission.<br>  We're getting out of here.<br>  Captain, we can't leave without answers.<br>  We'll find another way to get them.<br>  - Detmer, reverse course.<br> - DETMER: Aye, Captain.<br>  (COMPUTER BLIPPING)  I'm trying I should be able to re-chart  a course using galactic positioning,  but it's not working.<br>  SARU: This void.<br>  We have no reference points within it.<br>  If I go the wrong direction, I could take us deeper in.<br>  Zora, can you triangulate  a navigational reference using prior flight path data?  ZORA: No, Captain, I cannot.<br>  Commander Stamets.<br>  We need you to jump us out of here now.<br>  Jumping carries unknown risks, Captain.<br>  BURNHAM: So does staying.<br>  Have someone monitor systems during the jump.<br>  If the DMA caused this, any data we get will be valuable.<br>  Someone else might miss something.<br>  I'll make the jump.<br> You focus on the data.<br>  (STAMMERS) I, uh  I suppose now's as good a time as any to learn to delegate.<br>  BURNHAM: You ready, Book?  Ready.<br>  Black alert.<br>  (ALERT BLARING)  Jump.<br>  (WARBLING)  - (YELLS) - Abort!
