                    			1 Previously on Star Trek: Discovery  What is happening to you?  I don't think I'm Ash Tyler, Starfleet Lieutenant.<br>  Not really.<br> Not anymore.<br>  L'RELL: We modified Voq into a shell that appears human.<br>  We grafted his psyche into Tyler's.<br>  I do not know where your Voq ends and our Tyler begins,  but they are both in jeopardy.<br>  Only my hands can tend to him.<br>  (SCREAMS, GROANS)  Logic tells me she's not the one that I betrayed.<br>  She's a ghost.<br>  (GROANS)  I have no future now.<br>  Find a way home.<br> I will buy you some time.<br>  Get out of there, now.<br>  What have you done to me?  If we blow the reactor core,  the resulting explosion will be pure mycelial energy.<br>  We can ride it long enough  for the energy to activate the drive,  and then you can navigate us home.<br>  We overshot by nine months.<br>  If the map is to be believed,  it appears the Klingons have won the war.<br>  Captain.<br>  Emperor.<br>  On your knees, slave.<br>  This Kelpien is my captain.<br>  (EXHALES)  Sir, I can explain.<br>  Yesterday we dined on the entrails of his brethren.<br>  And today you seek his favor?  Transport our visitor to guest quarters  on deck three  and confine her there now.<br>  You told me there were no Kelpiens  in the other universe.<br> You lied.<br>  I hoped to spare you the pain.<br>  The presence of a Terran defector  on this ship is to be regarded as classified.<br>  Its utterance will carry a penalty of treason.<br>  - Do you understand? - Aye, Captain.<br>  COMPUTER: Captain, your presence is requested in sickbay.<br>  With me.<br>  (DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN)  I could offer excuses.<br> (ELECTRIC WELDER CRACKLES)  I was trying to destabilize the Terran Empire.<br>  I I thought Starfleet could benefit  from learning about an alternate universe.<br>  The truth is that I just couldn't  watch her die again, Saru.<br>  I wanted to offer her more.<br>  I am sorry.<br>  Saving Georgiou may indeed prove  to be a grave error in judgment.<br>  But  no one else could have done what you did  aboard that Terran flagship.<br>  You are alive,  and we are home.<br>  Any news from Command?  Federation ships have appeared on long-range sensors,  but none answer my hail.<br>  Doesn't feel much like home.<br>  (ELECTRICAL SURGES)  Discovery suffered damage riding the mycelial shock wave  back into our universe.<br>  We are running on auxiliary power  until repairs are complete.<br>  Deck four.<br>  Dr.<br> Pollard has orders to alert me  when Lieutenant Tyler regains consciousness.<br>  An emergency surgical procedure proved necessary.<br>  An attempt to excise the Klingon  in Tyler's neurological identity.<br>  How?  What happened to him was completely outside  of the realm of sanctioned medicine.<br>  Starfleet did not perform the procedure.<br>  It was the Klingon L'Rell.<br>  His torturer?  And handler.<br>  She oversaw Tyler's transformation.<br>  None of us are sure what state we might find him in.<br>  I am hoping that a familiar face  could offer him encouragement to heal.<br>  How he reacts to you may offer us insight  into who he has become.<br>  Captain, he's awake.<br>  Is that an order, Captain?  I fail to understand.<br>  Is that an order? To see him?  No.<br>  I'm sorry.<br>  I can't.<br>  What are your findings, Doctor?  By all assessments, the patient now presents as Ash Tyler.<br>  Adrenocorticotropic hormonal levels are normal.<br>  Cellular mitochondria counts are back within human range.<br>  I find no remaining evidence of Klingon aggression  or muscular stamina.<br>  So, is he human or Klingon?  (SIGHS) Neither.<br> Both.<br>  We can't be sure.<br>  Not without understanding the science  behind the reassignment procedure.<br>  And how do we do that?  I suppose we could start by asking him.<br>  (SIGHS)  SARU: Tyler?  Mr.<br> Saru.<br>  - Thanks for the save.<br> - And Voq?  I can access his memories,  but there's a disconnect.<br>  Like watching someone else's life or something.<br>  Do you remember what was done to you?  The Mo'Kai call it a choH' a'.<br>  Species reassignment protocol.<br>  Specifically designed to infiltrate  classified Starfleet intelligence.<br>  Are there others?  Voq was the test case.<br>  They flayed his skin.<br>  Cracked his bones open.<br>  Sawed his heart into pieces.<br>  You think that'll be the worst of it.<br>  Then they start shaving down the tips of your fingers.<br>  Voq was T'Kuvma's Torchbearer.<br>  He submitted to the torture willingly, at L'Rell's behest.<br>  They were the only true believers left.<br>  Voq and L'Rell believed taking the ship would  bring followers back to T'Kuvma's house.<br>  They were in love, you know.<br>  I  Will you cooperate with us?  Share everything you know?  Of course.<br>  I  I would do anything to undo what I've done.<br>  Is she alive?  Uh, Specialist Burnham has  returned safely aboard Discovery.<br>  (EXHALES)  Thank God.<br>  - Can I - Focus  on your recovery.<br>  You both survived a harrowing ordeal.<br>  Saru, I tried to kill her.<br>  I murdered  Dr.<br> Culber.<br>  I belong in the brig.<br>  Voq is responsible for your crimes.<br>  And I see no semblance of him before me.<br>  Your privileges aboard Discovery will be limited.<br>  But I will not take your freedom.<br>  (DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT)  (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)  Vessel is approaching, sir.<br>  Federation signature.<br>  Hail them at once.<br>  Aye, Captain.<br>  Captain, its shields are up.<br>  It-Its phasers are charged and targeting.<br>  Shields up.<br>  I'm picking up an incoming transporter signature.<br>  We're being boarded.<br>  Identify yourselves!  Hands where I can see them!  (INDISTINCT SHOUTING)  I demand an explanation for this intrusion!  We ask the questions.<br> (COMM CHIRPS)  Clear for transport.<br>  Admiral  Where's Captain Lorca?  - Sarek!

They think nothing of the collateral damage  caused by their brutal attacks.<br>  They target civilians, hospitals, food convoys.<br>  They slaughter innocents and inspire terror  across the quadrant.<br> This is war,  not a child's game with rules.<br>  We fight to preserve Klingon identity.<br>  No one is looking to destroy your culture.<br>  Our laws are founded in equality.<br> Freedom.<br>  T'Kuvma taught us that the Federation cannot help itself.<br>  It seeks universal homogenization and assimilation.<br>  T'Kuvma was an ignorant fool.<br>  And your people are moving closer and closer  to my home planet.<br>  What are you looking for?  More territory?  Conditional surrender?  I mean, your people won't even make demands.<br> Why?  How does this war end?  It doesn't.<br>  Klingons have tasted your blood.<br>  Conquer us  or we will never relent.<br>  Thank you.<br>  (DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN)  (DOOR WHOOSHES SHUT)  There's been a change of plans.<br>  Another Klingon attack.<br>  You'll have to stay on board  Discovery a little while longer.<br>  It makes no difference.<br>  One cell in this universe is as good as another.<br>  You heard your admiral.<br>  We mean you no harm.<br>  The admiral was just  Tell me about the Vulcan.<br>  There is a connection between the two of you.<br>  Why would you say that?  The way you look at him  is not unlike the way you look at me.<br>  He's essentially my father.<br>  He raised me.<br>  So you were orphaned here as well?  Another echo of fate between our worlds.<br>  Your rule extends through every system in your galaxy.<br>  You've conquered places  Starfleet hasn't even dared to explore.<br>  I see now  that the time for peace has passed.<br>  I need you to tell me,  how did you defeat the Klingon Empire?  I started this war, and I need to finish it.<br>  Why did you bring me here?  Truly.<br>  I wanted to show you a place of morality,  of hope.<br>  Let me tell you,  daughter who is not my daughter.<br>  In truth, you wished to save me because you couldn't save her.<br>  This regret that you have for what you did,  it weakens you.<br>  I feel it every day of my life.<br>  The Klingons are like cancer cells: constantly dividing.<br>  To root them out,  you must destroy the tumor at its source.<br>  How much do you know about Qo'noS?  I suppose I don't have to tell you  it's the middle of the night.<br>  I have a proposal.<br>  SHUKAR: I left Discovery  only to learn that a Klingon attack is imminent.<br>  They are gathering forces to launch a strike  on this whole system.<br>  The Klingons are taking the fight to us.<br>  We need to take it to them, to Qo'noS.<br>  Attack the Klingon homeworld?  CORNWELL: Not a simple attack.<br>  A simultaneous strike on their planetary-defense batteries,  immediately followed by the coordinated destruction  of all military targets planetwide.<br>  A single offensive so destructive,  it will force the enemy to retreat from Federation space  and head for home.<br>  SHUKAR: Our remaining fleet  is being called back to defend Earth.<br>  Discovery should join them.<br>  SAREK: Each path of logic leads to the same conclusion:  Starfleet tactics have failed us.<br>  We must adapt if we're to have any hope of survival.<br>  Qo'noS is uncharted territory.<br>  We have no idea where their defense batteries are,  much less their weapon production systems or shipyards.<br>  SHUKAR: The planet's dense upper atmosphere prevents  long-range topographical and energy analysis.<br>  And no Starfleet officer has set foot there in this century.<br>  DRAKE: Your strategy's a good one, Katrina.<br>  But it's not feasible without a map.<br>  And by the time Discovery got close enough to begin surveying,  they'd blow her out of the sky.<br>  She's not gonna be in the sky.<br>  CORNWELL: Let's go over it again.<br>  Qo'noS is composed of a subterranean series  of now dormant volcanoes.<br>  It is a planet of caves.<br>  STAMETS: Some of them, according to Specialist Burnham's intel,  are big enough to house a Crossfield-class starship.<br>  BURNHAM: Rather than surveil our targets from orbit,  we can map the terrain from the inside out.<br>  Thereby minimizing our risk of detection.<br>  SARU: Jumping a massive starship  inside a cave  of impenetrable rock does seem, uh, challenging.<br>  Travel aboard the mycelial network is, in itself,  a sort of advanced  detection system of geophysical imaging.<br>  I can easily identify the voids in energy  that would represent a chasm versus a solid mass.<br>  BURNHAM: And once we're in position  within the cave system,  we'll release our surveillance drone  to collect the necessary tactical information.<br>  Good.<br>  Because I've assured Starfleet we can do this.<br>  And by "we," I mean you.<br>  It's a good plan, Specialist.<br>  - Well done.<br> - Thank you, Admiral.<br>  One question: how do we get the spores  necessary to make the jump?  We'll have to grow them ourselves.<br>  SARU: My understanding is that your crop  took years to cultivate.<br>  Set a course for the Veda system.<br>  And  get ready for a show.<br>  Prototaxites stellaviatori.<br>  My original sample,  and the last-remaining mycelium of this strain.<br>  We are headed to an uninhabited class-4 moon  in the Veda system.<br>  And if this works, I might even let you name it.<br>  You're gonna terraform a moon?  Your own research on the success  of an organic mycelial harvest was indeterminable.<br>  I've studied your data myself  Straal quashed it.<br>  He wanted to keep the crop captive,  but if ever there was a time to go wild  Your child is lost.<br>  SAREK: Do not confuse  my ward with yours.<br>  My daughter  was a singular example of brilliance  until one foolish choice doomed her world.<br>  Sound familiar?  If I understand correctly,  my ward saw through the man who brought down  not just your child, but your empire.<br>  Perhaps best not to make comparisons.<br>  Why have you requested my presence?  You were summoned, Vulcan, for one reason.<br>  I want to help you end this war.<br>  The information  you provided Michael has already proved valuable.<br>  I told her as much as she could handle.<br>  Our daughters are not so unlike after all.<br>  In my world,  Qo'noS is little more than a blackened mass of dust.<br>  The Klingons fight for scraps and fear certain death.<br>  But it took a great deal more  than a mapping drone in a cave to get there.<br>  You assured Michael that your plan would prove effective.<br>  And it will, momentarily.<br>  But they will regroup.<br>  Their longing to destroy the symbol that is Earth  runs far too deep.<br>  What if I could show you how to bring them to their knees  once and for all?  The Federation does not subscribe  to what I imagine are Terran methods of combat.<br>  You face annihilation.<br>  Is it not logical  to do anything you can to save the lives of your kind?  Give me what I want,  and I can assure victory for the Federation.<br>  What are your terms?  Freedom.<br>  I must return to Vulcan.<br>  There are evolving details to the plan  that must be considered.<br>  What evolving details?  I sense you are uneasy.<br>  During my mind-meld with Saru,  I learned of your attachment to the Klingon spy  and what he did to you.<br>  Such events are clearly troubling.<br>  I'm fine, Sarek.<br>  I remain unconvinced.<br>  There is irony here, of course.<br>  The man you fell in love with was a Klingon.<br>  He  I don't know what he was.<br>  There is also grace.<br>  For what greater source of peace exists  than our ability to love our enemy?  I've made foolish choices.<br>  Emotional choices.<br>  Well, you are human.<br>  As is your mother.<br>  There is no telling what any one of us may do  where the heart is concerned.<br>  We are at war.<br>  Logic dictates that each farewell may be our last.<br>  Do not regret loving someone, Michael.<br>  Admiral Cornwell requested a status report.<br>  This is the last of the mycelial transport vessels.<br>  We will be able to launch by the time we reach Veda.<br>  I just said good-bye to my father, and it felt different.<br>  Final.<br>  It won't be, right?  Did you ever think, when you signed up for Starfleet,  that you'd be forced to see war and death?  Death found me when I was a child.<br>  So, yeah.<br>  I knew what I was getting into.<br>  I don't think I did.<br>  Not really.<br>  Does that make me naive?  It makes you optimistic.<br>  When we were in the Terran universe,  I was reminded how much a person is shaped  by their environment.<br>  And I think the only way that w we can stop ourselves  from becoming them  is to understand the darkness within us, and fight it.<br>  Tyler needs you.<br>  I'm told he's doing well.<br>  That's not possible, not when you've lost the person  - you care about the most.<br> - He killed  a Starfleet officer.<br>  And he  he tried to kill me.<br>  And those crimes are reprehensible,  but Tyler is not the person who did that,  at least he's he's not anymore.<br>  He is something other, someone new.<br>  And what we do now, the way that we treat him,  that is who he will become.<br>  I know you still care about him.<br>  I do.<br>  That does not mean I should.<br>  Michael, he's been stripped of his badge.<br>  He'll never fly for Starfleet again.<br>  He'll be lucky if he doesn't end up in a lab or a cell.<br>  What kind of future can he have?  Say what you have to say, even if it's good-bye.<br>  Lieutenant Stamets, your stop.<br>  Locked and loaded, Admiral.<br>  Detmer, put her into geostationary orbit.<br>  Locking in  approximately 800 kilometers above the moon's surface.<br>  STAMETS: Copy that.<br>  Initiating mycelial ejection protocol.<br>  Engaging agri-transport boosters.<br>    Status, Lieutenant Stamets.<br>  STAMETS: Sensors from the terraforming field  show root structures forming in zones 922  and 5041.<br>  Ready the EM darts.<br>  TILLY: Darts calibrated.<br>  Fire.<br>  (DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN)  Come on, kiddos.<br>  Come on.<br>    COMPUTER: Spore generation at four percent.<br>  Eight percent.<br>  Twelve percent.<br>  Fifteen percent.<br>  Nineteen percent.<br>  Twenty-two percent.<br>  Twenty-seven percent.<br>  CORNWELL: I would congratulate you, Lieutenant,  but I'm afraid the work has just begun.<br>  COMPUTER: Forty-seven percent.<br>  Fifty-two percent.<br>  (DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN)  I don't know where to start.<br>  I do.<br>  I'm sorry.<br>  I know there's no way I can prove this to you,  but Voq, he's gone.<br>  I believe you.<br>  Was there ever really an Ash Tyler?  And did he love me?  Because I loved him.<br>  You lied to me.<br>  You said that if it got to be too much,  that if you couldn't handle it,  you would come to me.<br>  And it did.<br>  And you didn't.<br>  And that wasn't Voq, that was you.<br>  Tyler.<br>  Who the hell is Tyler?  You think I know anymore?  You think I have any idea who I am now, where I belong?  This isn't about a lie.<br>  This is about you looking for an excuse to end it.<br>  "Excuse"?  My crewmates have been kinder than they need to be.<br>  Why are you, the person who knows me best,  so quick to turn your back?  - Stop.<br> - I want you to admit it.<br>  Admit that you can't do this anymore  because you finally went there with someone  and things got complicated.<br>  Because your parents were killed by Klingons  and you fell in love with one.<br>  (EXHALES)  Maybe you're right.<br>  I know in my head  that you couldn't be responsible for Voq's actions  but I felt your hands  around my neck.<br>  And I looked into your eyes  and I saw how much you wanted to kill me.<br>  The man that I love wanted me dead.<br>  And no matter how hard I try,  when I look at you now,  I see Voq's eyes.<br>  I see him.<br>  Your crew may have put it behind them, but I can't.<br>  I shouldn't be here.<br>  I should be an activated Klingon spy,  behind bars or dead.<br>  Michael, the reason it didn't take,  the reason L'Rell couldn't get through to me, that was you.<br>  Did Ash Tyler love you?  Hell yes, he did.<br>  And I can't find my way back without you.<br>  (SIGHS)  We created something beautiful today  in a desolate wasteland  that had never seen life.<br>  After the Battle of the Binary Stars  I was so lost.<br>  I had to sit with myself.<br>  I had to work through it.<br>  I had to crawl my way back.<br>  I'm still not there, but  I'm trying.<br>  That kind of work  reclaiming life  it's punishing  and it's relentless.<br>  And it's solitary.<br>  No, I  Ash.<br>  It's not easy  letting you go.<br>  (SNIFFLES)  (SIGHS)  CORNWELL: The mycelial bloom was successful.<br>  A spore harvest is underway.<br>  Then the jump to Qo'noS will be possible?  Yes.<br> Imminently.<br>  The Federation Council has been briefed  on our newly acquired intelligence from the Terran.<br>  Despite the extraordinary risk,  all are agreed that we have no choice but to proceed.<br>  Our very existence hangs in the balance.<br>  Then it's time.<br>  Open a shipwide channel.<br>  We have all mourned  the enormous loss of life due to this war.<br>  The acts of violence committed against us are the acts of a foe  without reason, without honor.<br>  And they will not stop coming after us in the hopes  of destroying everything that we hold dear.<br>  These are desperate times  and they call on us to do more than merely protect our people,  defend our borders.<br>  I stand before you with a mission.<br>  At 2100 hours, the USS Discovery  will jump for the Klingon homeworld  in order to map its surface  and isolate vulnerabilities  and military targets.<br>  This brave team  will be the first to visit  this inhospitable planet  since Captain Archer and the crew  of the Enterprise NX-01,  nearly 100 years ago.<br>  So allow me to introduce you  to the person who will chart your course to Qo'noS.<br>  Captain Philippa Georgiou.<br>  Thank you.<br>  CORNWELL: Though long presumed dead,  Captain Georgiou  was recently rescued  in a highly classified raid  of a Klingon prison vessel.<br>  She was transported aboard Discovery  with my personal retinue.<br>  The mission to Qo'noS is a perilous expedition.<br>  And Starfleet is confident  that Captain Georgiou  is uniquely qualified to get you there  and to do what needs to be done.<br>  Specialist Burnham,  I trust that this will be an auspicious reunion,  despite our history.<br>  Now take your station.<br>  Yes Captain.<br>      <br>
