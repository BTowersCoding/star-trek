                    			1 Previously on Star Trek: Discovery  We got you, Gray.<br> We'll find a way to help you be seen,  truly seen.<br>  I can't believe I get to start my life again.<br>  BURNHAM: Book? You there?  BOOK: I keep seeing him.<br>  Leto.<br> I don't know if he knew,  if I ever let him know how much I loved him.<br>  I'm sorry.<br>  I'm gonna figure this thing out for you, whatever it takes.<br>  TILLY: Starfleet Academy feels like 1,000 years ago.<br>  Nothing feels simple anymore.<br>  It's okay to feel that way.<br>  I don't know if something's off or, uh, I'm off.<br>  I was kind of hoping that we could talk about it sometime.<br>  VANCE: What exactly is this anomaly?  STAMETS: We're not certain.<br>  We know it's there, we know it's moving,  but we can't get a handle  on what it is.<br>  I offer the services of the Ni'Var Science Institute.<br>  A crisis such as this requires all to contribute.<br>  This anomaly threatens us all equally.<br>  We must all work together.<br>    This is Commander Fickett of the USS Credence.<br>  We have your dilithium shipment ready.<br>  WOMAN: We are grateful to receive it, Commander.<br>  It has been a long time.<br>  FICKETT: Always happy to help.<br>  - Looking good.<br> - Everything is ready, Commander.<br>  - We have their coordinates.<br> - Good work.<br>  Thank you, Lieutenants.<br>  Computer, lower the shields for transfer.<br>  Locking on your coordinates now.<br>  - COMPUTER: Security breach.<br> - (ALARM BLARING)  (GRUNTING AND GROANING)  Commander!  Stand down.<br>  (ALARM CONTINUES BLARING)  I need to take your dilithium.<br>  You can wait your turn like everybody else.<br>  I'm afraid that's not possible.<br> Please step aside.<br>  It's not gonna happen.<br>  No.<br>  (GROANS)  Please, my friend, choose to live.<br>  (YELLS)  I'm sorry.<br>  VANCE: Fourth and most recent  in a string of identical dilithium thefts.<br>  Killing a Starfleet officer, though  that's new.<br>  The killer is a Ni'Var citizen  and a Qowat Milat nun known as J'Vini.<br>  Her cohorts are mercenaries  confirmed to be operating under her orders.<br>  Thanks to the tracker we planted in the dilithium she stole,  we now have her coordinates.<br>  You said these thefts began  shortly after the gravitational anomaly was discovered.<br>  Might there be a connection?  As of now, we have no indication of motive.<br>  J'Vini's crimes, however, are clear.<br>  She must be detained without delay.<br>  T'RINA: This would be an appropriate time  for the Qowat Milat to join us.<br>  Thank you, President T'Rina.<br>  RILLAK: Admiral, Ni'Var is a trusted ally of the Federation.<br>  Despite the fact that these crimes  were committed on Starfleet vessels,  we will not respond without Ni'Var's guidance.<br>  Thank you.<br>  Indeed, we are more than allies.<br>  It is my hope that we will soon be united  under the flag of the Federation.<br>  The dangers posed by the anomaly make our cooperation  all the more important.<br>  It is my understanding that,  at the moment, no inhabited systems are threatened  by its trajectory, yet it could change course at any time.<br>  That is the case, Madam President.<br>  Commander Stamets has been leading the efforts  to better understand its movements.<br>  He's eager to start collaborating  with the Ni'Var Science Institute.<br>  And they are ready to receive him.<br>  Here, too, we offer our services.<br>  This is an internal Qowat Milat matter,  and as such, we ask  that Starfleet turn her coordinates over to us.<br>  We believe J'Vini most likely is acting  as a galankhkan on behalf of a lost cause.<br>  VANCE: "Most likely"?  You have doubts?  No.<br>  I have faith.<br>  Why would she steal the dilithium?  The Federation is giving it away.<br>  I don't know.<br> This is the first news  we've heard of J'Vini in several years.<br>  But I trust she has a reason.<br>  The order must be allowed to discover that context.<br>  Mom.<br>  She killed a Starfleet officer.<br>  You cannot excuse that with context.<br>  We do not excuse J'Vini's actions.<br>  However, we must be the ones to pursue her.<br>  I fear no one but her sisters  will be able to bring her in alive.<br>  The unique ways of the Qowat Milat  must be respected.<br>  RILLAK: Admiral Vance,  would Starfleet be amenable to making this a joint mission?  A venture of mutual goodwill would reflect the spirit  of the pending union between Ni'Var and the Federation.<br>  Under the circumstances,  we would, of course, be amenable.<br>  As would the Qowat Milat.<br>  Well, might I suggest Captain Burnham  be permitted to represent Starfleet?  She has my confidence.<br>  And, dare I say, the confidence of her mother.<br>  Whatever J'Vini's circumstances, I think we can all agree  that these actions cannot be allowed to continue.<br>  Bring her in.<br>  Safely.<br>  I'll prepare to leave immediately.<br>  As will I.<br>  Captain.<br>  If we may speak frankly?  Of course.<br>  This joint mission is a political necessity.<br>  Ni'Var and the Qowat Milat must feel respected,  but make no mistake you are in charge.<br>  I thought we landed on "mutual goodwill" back there.<br>  Goodwill and leadership are two different things.<br>  This anomaly,  it is the biggest threat we have faced since the Burn.<br>  This is our moment to serve  and to show why restoring the Federation is so critical.<br>  We cannot do that without Ni'Var.<br>  But we also can't do it if those who attack us  don't see our strength.<br>  J'Vini must be brought in.<br>  Absolutely.<br>  If you feel your relationship with your mother will make this  -
